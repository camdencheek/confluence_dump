  Pages and blogs
</h3>
Everything you create in Confluence, from meeting notes to retrospectives and everything in between, takes the form of either pages or blogs.
<ul>
  <li>
    Your homepage will be the first thing that visitors to your site see, so to help them find relevant content, start by curating your homepage with useful macros and including information about what is in your space. See

  </li>
  <li>
    If you&#39;re creating content that is specific mainly to the current time­frame, and isn&#39;t going to change over time, create it as a blog post. Your blog displays as an infinite scroll, so it surfaces the latest news and visitors just need to scroll down if they&#39;re interested in older content.
  </li>
  <li>
    If you&#39;re creating content that you want to last, and possibly evolve over time, then create it as a page. Pages nest, so every page can have its own child pages, which lets you organize your content into categories and subcategories.
  </li>
</ul>

</h3>
You can customize your space sidebar to make it easier to navigate through your space.
<ul>
  <li>
    The space shortcuts section of the sidebar lets you link to important content. You can use this to highlight pertinent pages within your space, related content from other spaces, or to external content that is relevant to your space.
  </li>
  <li>
    The navigation display lists all of the pages in your space in either a page tree or child pages format. If you only want some content to be visible in the sidebar, you can hide the navigation display and put the pages you want to remain visible under Space shortcuts instead.
  </li>
</ul>
<h3 id="Organizeyourspaces-Usinglabels">
  Using labels
</h3>
Labels are keywords or tags that you can add to pages, blog posts, and attachments.
<ul>
  <li>
    Define your own labels and use them to categorize, identify, or bookmark content in Confluence. For example, if you assign the label &#39;accounting&#39; to all accounts ­related pages on your site, you&#39;ll then be able to:
  </li>
</ul>
<ol>
  <li>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Browse all pages with that label in a single space or across the site.
      </li>
      <li>
        Display a list of pages with that label.
      </li>
      <li>
        Search based on that label.
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ol>
<ul>
  <li>
    Use the

      Organize your spaces
    </a>
     to create a table of contents for your space that is organized by label categories.
  </li>
  <li>
    Labels aren&#39;t exclusive, so you can have as many labels as you want on a page. The page will then appear under each of those categories. See

If you have lots of people creating in the same space, things can get messy fast. You can prevent this by taking a few easy steps.
<h3 id="Organizeyourspaces-Createasetofguidelines">
  Create a set of guidelines
</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    Let your collaborators know about what parent pages to create their child pages under, so no content gets lost or misplaced.
  </li>
  <li>
    Decide on standard labels to add to pages, blogs, and attachments so all content gets neatly categorized.
  </li>
  <li>
    Add a link to this in the Space Shortcuts section of the sidebar so that it&#39;s easy to find.
  </li>
</ul>

  Create your own page templates
</h3>
<a href="https://templates.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/RD/pages/33312/Organize+your+spaces" rel="nofollow">
  Create your own templates
</a>
 for any content that you want formatted the same way every time. For example, if you have to create a regular report tracking the same criteria, create a template with headings, variable dates, tables, and spaces for any graphics, so that each time all you have to do is input the new data instead of creating the whole report from scratch.
