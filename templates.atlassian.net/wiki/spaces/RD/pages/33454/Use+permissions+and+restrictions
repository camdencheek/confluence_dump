              As a tool for communication and collaboration, we believe Confluence is at its best when everyone can participate fully. That&#39;s why space and page permissions are open by
              <span>
                default
              </span>
              , which means anyone can view, create, and edit content. Confluence keeps a history of all changes to your content, so it&#39;s easy to see who has changed what, and reverse any changes if you need to.
            </p>
            <p>
              Confluence does, however, give you the choice to make your site, spaces, and pages as open or closed as you want to.

        <p>
          Every space has its own independent set of permissions, as chosen by its admin(s). The space admin can choose who has permission to:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            View, add, or delete content
          </li>
          <li>
            Add or delete comments
          </li>
          <li>
            Restrict pages and blogs
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          You&#39;re automatically an admin for any space you create, including your personal space. Read more about space permissions in the guide to administering spaces.

          Say you&#39;re working on a draft with someone and don&#39;t want anyone else to be able to see it until it&#39;s done. Or you have some sensitive information that you need to share with a select group before opening it up to a wider audience. This is where page restrictions come in handy.
        </p>
        <p>
          Page restrictions let you set, edit, and view restrictions on a specific page or blog post.

          How do permissions interact?
        </h2>
        <p>
          Restrictions and permissions don&#39;t override each other. To view a page, you need view permissions for both the page and the space it&#39;s in.
        </p>
        <p>
          Page restrictions are inherited, so any restrictions added to a parent page will also apply to all of its child pages.
        </p>
        <p>
          If someone&#39;s a space admin, and you&#39;ve used page restrictions to prevent them viewing a page in their space, they won&#39;t be able to see the page when they navigate to it. They can, however, view a list of restricted pages and remove their restrictions.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>
            What about links?
          </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          Space permissions and page restrictions affect how links between Confluence pages are displayed.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            If someone doesn&#39;t have
            <strong>
              View
            </strong>
            <strong>
              space
            </strong>
             permissions, links to pages in that space aren&#39;t shown to them.
          </li>
          <li>
            If someone has
            <strong>
              View
            </strong>
            <strong>
              space
            </strong>
             permissions, but the page has view restrictions, the link is visible but they&#39;ll get an &#34;access denied&#34; message when they click it.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Links to attachments are also affected. If the visitor doesn&#39;t have permission to view the page the attachment lives on, the link isn&#39;t rendered.
