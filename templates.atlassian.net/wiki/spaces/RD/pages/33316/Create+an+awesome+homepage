When you create a space, Confluence automatically creates a home page for that space. Spaces created with a blueprint come with a ready-made home page populated with useful macros and sample content specific to the blueprint&#39;s use case.However, even if you&#39;ve started with a blank space, you can still customize your home page to make it easier for everyone using that space to navigate their way around and find useful content.















<ul>
  <li>
    What is this space about? Your home page is the first page visitors will see when they visit your space, so it helps to include some information about what the space is about, and what you&#39;re working on. You can use the
    <a href="https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/ConfCloud/Info%2C+Tip%2C+Note%2C+and+Warning+Macros" rel="nofollow">
      Info, Tip, Note, and Warning Macros
    </a>
     to create a colored box in which to put this information.
  </li>
  <li>
    What is in this space? You can use the
    <a href="https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/ConfCloud/Content+Report+Table+Macro" rel="nofollow">
      Content Report Table Macro
    </a>
     to create a table of contents for your space. You can also set this macro to only display content with a particular label, so if you would like only some content to display, you can do this by adding that label to only those pages and blogs you want listed on your home page.
  </li>
  <li>
    Organize your space with labels You can organize content in your space with labels, so that for example, if you have a Learning and Development space, you can create different labels for online learning resources, upcoming workshops, and training strategy. You can then use the
    <a href="https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/ConfCloud/Labels+List+Macro" rel="nofollow">
      Labels List Macro
    </a>
     to create a list of those labels to make it easy for visitors to your space to find the content relating to each of those topics.
  </li>
  <li>
    Add a search box so that it&#39;s easy to find content within your space The
    <a href="https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/ConfCloud/Livesearch+Macro" rel="nofollow">
      Livesearch Macro
    </a>
     allows you to add a search box to a Confluence page, and you can set it to only find content within your space.
  </li>
  <li>
    Keep everyone updated about the latest changes within your space If it&#39;s important for your visitors to know about the latest changes to your space, you can use the
    <a href="https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/ConfCloud/Recently+Updated+Macro" rel="nofollow">
      Recently Updated Macro
    </a>
     to display a list of the most recently updated content. You can set the space parameter to show this for just your space, or, if you have related spaces, to show the most recently updated content across all of those spaces as well.
  </li>
  <li>
    Using JIRA? Create and display your JIRA issues on Confluence If your Confluence site is connected to a JIRA application, you can both create and display your JIRA issues without having to leave Confluence using the
    <a href="https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/ConfCloud/JIRA+Issues+Macro" rel="nofollow">
