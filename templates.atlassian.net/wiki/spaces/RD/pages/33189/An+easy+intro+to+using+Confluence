           to anything you want to keep private, and showcase everything else, so visitors to your personal space can see all the awesome things you&#39;ve been working on.
        </p>
        <p>
          Anything you store on Confluence is fully searchable, and because it&#39;s in the cloud, you can access it from anywhere. Easily share it with other users, or export to pdf or word to share it externally.

            Store files where everyone can find them
          </strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          Forget emailing files back and forth, or having to search for the latest version of something. Confluence has version control built in, so you can
          <a href="https://confluence.atlassian.com/confcloud/files-724765100.html" rel="nofollow">
            store files
          </a>
           on it for everyone to view and download.
        </p>
        <p>
          Every time you change your file, re-upload the new version to Confluence with the same name and Confluence will save it as a new version - so everyone can be sure that the file they&#39;re viewing or editing is up-to-date.
        </p>
        <p>
          All the old versions are also stored, so if you ever need to revert to an old version, or just want to track what changes have been made between each saved version, you can!

          Creating a lot of the same kinds of documents? Save time by creating them as templates instead.

        </p>
        <p>
          Creating templates also helps onboard new users and makes creating content easier for everyone – they can just follow the instructions on the page.

          This isn&#39;t static news - your viewers can inline comment to ask for further clarification on any points, or start a discussion using page comments.

          If you&#39;d prefer not to enable comments, you can always turn them off by deselecting the

        <p>
          Instead of having information stored on individuals&#39; computers or as hard copies, where it&#39;s hard to find, use Confluence as a central repository of information, where all your files and documents can be organised, searched, and filtered.
        </p>
        <p>
          Anything out of date or obsolete can be

          </a>
          , so it&#39;s still available for reference and for record keeping, but remains hidden away so it isn&#39;t creating unnecessary clutter. Archived content won&#39;t appear in searches unless you choose to search for archived results.

        <p>
          Inline and file comments mean that they can comment directly on the content they&#39;re providing feedback about, so your discussions stay in context.
        </p>
        <p>
          Clean up your reading experience by resolving inline comments once they&#39;re dealt with. Page comments can include rich formatting, images and even macros, enabling meaningful discussions.
