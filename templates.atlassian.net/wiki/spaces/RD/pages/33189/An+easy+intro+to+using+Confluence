Easily share it with other users, or export to pdf or word to share it externally. Store files where everyone can find themForget emailing files back and forth, or having to search for the latest version of something. Confluence has version control built in, so you can

  store files
</a>
 on it for everyone to view and download.Every time you change your file, re-upload the new version to Confluence with the same name and Confluence will save it as a new version - so everyone can be sure that the file they&#39;re viewing or editing is up-to-date.All the old versions are also stored, so if you ever need to revert to an old version, or just want to track what changes have been made between each saved version, you can! Create templates for faster and easier content creationCreating a lot of the same kinds of documents? Save time by creating them as templates instead.
