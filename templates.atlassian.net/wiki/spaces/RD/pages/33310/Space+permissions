Each space in Confluence has its own set of permissions, which can be granted and revoked by a space administrator.
<ul>
  <li>
    Whoever creates a space, like when you create your personal space, is automatically an administrator of that space, and can add other space admins if they want to by adding the Space Admin permission to another user or group.
  </li>
  <li>
    If you&#39;re one of those lucky space admins, you can assign permissions for the space to individual users, groups, or anonymous users.
  </li>
  <li>
    To change permissions for a space, choose Space tools &gt; Permissions from the bottom of the sidebar, then choose Edit Permissions to change permission settings.
  </li>
  <li>
    You can also manage watchers for that space by choosing Watch &gt; Manage Watchers at the top-right of any page in the space.
  </li>
</ul>
Tip: Groups
Confluence Administrators can put users into groups to make it easier to manage permissions. If you&#39;re not an administrator and want to know if someone belongs to a group, ask your administrator to check for you.

Did you know you can share your space with people who aren&#39;t logged in to Confluence? Here&#39;s what you need to do:
<ol>
  <li>
    Go to the space and choose Space tools &gt; Permissions from the bottom of the sidebar
  </li>
  <li>
    Choose Edit Permissions
  </li>
  <li>
    Scroll down to the Anonymous Access section and select the specific permissions you&#39;d like anonymous users to have
  </li>
  <li>
    Save All to apply the changes
  </li>
</ol>

 Making a space public doesn&#39;t let you choose who you want to share it with – a public space can be viewed by anyone inside or outside of your organization.

Tip: Check global permissions
In order to make a space public, your administrator must first turn on the
<a href="https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/ConfCloud/Global+Permissions+Overview" rel="nofollow">
  global permission for anonymous access
</a>
. This permission doesn&#39;t automatically grant anonymous users permission to see any of the content on your site, but it does need to be turned on to give space admins the option of granting anonymous users access to their space.
