  Need some more information? Here&#39;s the 101 on spaces: Spaces come in two main varieties:
<ul>
  <li>
    Site spaces – These are where you create content and collaborate with others.
  </li>
  <li>
    Personal spaces – Every Confluence user can set up a personal space to work in, which they can make private or leave open so others can see what they&#39;re working on. Click your profile picture to set up or visit your personal space.
  </li>
</ul>
You can find a full list of the spaces in the

 as many spaces as you need to get things done:
<ul>
  <li>
    Team spaces – Give each team (Engineering, HR, Marketing, Support, ...) their own space so they can focus and make their information easier for everyone to find.
  </li>
  <li>
    Project spaces – Put all the information related to your project in one place. This allows everyone to work together in Confluence instead of emailing back and forth.
  </li>
  <li>
    Personal space – Store everything you&#39;re working on individually, keep your to-do lists, and polish any content before you move it into another shared space.
  </li>
</ul>
