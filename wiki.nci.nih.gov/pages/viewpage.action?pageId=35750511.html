Section 5 &gt; caGRID 2.0 Platform and Terminology Integration &gt; Data Exploration and Query November 22 version
It says that the query capability must support sophisticated queries such as temporal queries and spatial queries. In that case, decision support earlier should mention support for temporal and spatial reasoning.


Resolution: This requirement is from the platform roadmap; the platform services provide access to data while the SI service provide access to metadata. The SI team is evaluating the requirement for this capability and will update the roadmap with its findings. Raghu Chintalapati

Section 5 &gt; caGRID 2.0 Platform and Terminology Integration &gt; Service Discovery November 22 version
The terms orchestration, choreography, and composition seem to be used interchangeably. The dynamic composibility of services, including runtime contract discovery, is a hard if not unsolvable task. The paragraph would benefit from a more careful wording, e.g., emphasizing design-time or semi-automatic composition, where specific services are discovered and composed to solve specific tasks. Note that in a composition of services, current state of the art abstracts services as one input/ one output only. Additionally taking into account more complicated choreographies of 2 services interacting is not feasible.


Resolution: The SI team is currently evaluating different approaches to identify the feasibility of automatic workflow composition. Based on the results of the prototyping phase, the roadmap will be updated. Raghu Chintalapati

Section 5 &gt; Service Discovery and Governance November 22 version
It states &#34;Service discovery and governance allows service developers to specify rich metadata about services&#34;. This should be the other way around: specify rich metadata about services allows service discovery?


Resolution: Agree. That statement is revised in the roadmap. Raghu Chintalapati

It states &#34;Service discovery and governance help to accomplish the following:&#34; where the last bullet is &#34;Enable better discovery&#34;. This is circular and similar to the above, it is the expressing of rich metadata that enables better discovery.


Resolution: The scope of the section is to outline a set of SI capabilities, specifically the governance and service discovery capabilities. The bullet describes this capability, the coverage here is not around specifying rich metadata but leveraging existing metadata for better service discovery. Raghu Chintalapati

Section 5 &gt; Service Discovery and Governance &gt; Service Discovery Functions November 22 version
The discovery functions are rather implementation-level (involving service endpoints and service interfaces). What about the discovery of services based on a declaratively specified goal or task and the rich metadata of services using semantic reasoning?


Resolution: This section lists some high-level requirements derived from the requirements section of the SI roadmap. Service discovery is expected to leverage semantic reasoning, the SI team is doing some prototyping to identify how semantic reasoning can be leveraged for service discovery. This section will be updated based on the findings of that exercise. Raghu Chintalapati
