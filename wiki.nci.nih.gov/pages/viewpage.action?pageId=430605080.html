            Scope: PDC is and will continue to be part of CRDC.  Areas: system design, PDC data model, data sharing, APIs and communication activities.  PDC in production, so focused on ongoing operations.  PDC will receive guidance from Advisory Committee.  Will maintain and update data submission/harmonization pipelines, update system with new data.  Monitor and report upon data quality.  Maintain and develop system features, usability and interoperability within CRDC.  Want to document use cases.  Monitor and report on use from both system and user perspectives.  Develop outreach options.
          </li>
          <li>
            Operating under an ATP (ESAC can bill).  Severable.  4/1/20-8/30/20 (new fiscal year starts 8/31/20).  Options will exist and will be covered in a contract mod and will include scope changes (Assay portal and DCC) - partly to remove duplication.  Anand did not include AWS charges in original rough estimate (about $20K per year) - PDC is connected to STRIDES and getting 15% discount - storage and compute - roughly $8-$9K for POP through 8/30/20.  Egress charges are NOT included.
          </li>
          <li>
            Monthly technical and financial reports: covers previous month&#39;s activities, templates will be provided, financial report needs projections (EAC).  Status meetings: weekly and as needed.
