Section 5 &gt; Clinical Data Forms Definition and Modeling &gt; Clinical Data Form Functions November 22 version
The clinical data form functions mention &#34;manage lifecycle, governance, and version of forms and document schemas&#34;. This seems to already have been captured in the Artifact Management Functions: &#34;manage lifecycle, governance and versioning of the models, content and forms&#34;. The listed use cases that drive these requirements are not explained further (compared to the previous sections).


Resolution: Agree, that statement is redundant and has been corrected in the roadmap. The requirements for forms have been derived largely from the caCIS project, clinical trials workspace and a generic set of use cases for supporting forms. The requirements section in the roadmap has additional coverage around forms use cases.
