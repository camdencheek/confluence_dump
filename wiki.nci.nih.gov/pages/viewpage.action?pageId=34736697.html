Section 6 &gt; Tie-in with Terminology and Platform &gt; Semantic Infrastructure Overview November 22 version
The first paragraph seems to be written from the perspective of a caGRID document, not of the SI document â€“ &#34;in an effort similar to this roadmap for the future platform&#34;.
Resolution:
Corrected and edited to focus the paragraph on Semantic Infrastructure.
