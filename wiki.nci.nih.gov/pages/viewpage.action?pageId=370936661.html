 The goal of the Workshop is to define semantic requirements and approaches to support query, submission, and analytical functions of the NCI CRDC. A particular focus will be on semantics that will inform plans for a Cancer Data Aggregator that will enable queries across commons nodes (e.g. different sources and data types) through their exposed metadata.  The expected outcomes of the workshop and its follow-up documentation will be (1) A requirements and evaluation document that identifies and summarizes a set high level requirements as well as including a variety of competency questions for semantic design and evaluation testing of the Cancer Data Aggregator. (2) A set of options/pros/cons for using and/or extending current approaches and resources in support of both semantic query capabilities and approaches to facilitate metadata annotation, validation, and submission. (3) A set of recommendations to support ongoing engagement with the community such that the semantics behind the Cancer Data Aggregator improve and evolve as people contribute to and use the CDA.Two pre-workshop webinars are being held to provide background information about the NCI CRDC and semantic resources, as well as Use cases for the CRDC.
