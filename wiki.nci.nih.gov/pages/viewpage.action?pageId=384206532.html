*  TPWAs are web-based technologies that are not exclusively operated or controlled by a government entity, or web-based technologies that involve significant participation of a non-government entity. Often these technologies are located on a &#34;.com&#34; website or other location that is not part of an official government domain. However, third-party applications can also be embedded or incorporated on an agency’s official website.
