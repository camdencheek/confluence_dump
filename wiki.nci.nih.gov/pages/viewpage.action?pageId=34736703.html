Comment 06 on Section 9
Section 9 &gt; Tools Recommended for Semantic Infrastructure Work November 22 version
Missing reference to CBIIT supported standards.
Resolution:
A link will be added when it is available. Issue resolved. Ann Wiley

Comment 05 on Section 9
Section 9 &gt; Tools Recommended for Semantic Infrastructure Work &gt; Triple Store Access November 22 version
Specify that ARQ supports the W3C standard SPARQL.
Resolution:
This is already present in the document. Eric Schripsema


Comment 04 on Section 9
Section 9 &gt; Tools Recommended for Semantic Infrastructure Work &gt; Semantic Knowledge Store November 22 version
Meaningless sentence: &#34;and datasets which can be used in a way which will allow for some amount of use within service environments&#34;
Resolution:
Clarified the intent of the sentence. Eric Schripsema


Comment 03 on Section 9
Section 9 &gt; Tools Recommended for Semantic Infrastructure Work &gt; Inference, Rules and Expert Systems November 22 version
Additional to RuleML, RIF --
<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/rif-overview/" rel="nofollow">
  http://www.w3.org/TR/rif-overview/
</a>
-- should be mentioned as the standard for rule exchange (it does for rules what OWL did for Description Logics).
Resolution:
Added as a possible standard for rule definition and expression. Eric Schripsema

Section 9 &gt; Tools Recommended for Semantic Infrastructure Work &gt; Inference, Rules and Expert Systems &gt; RDF and OWL Tools November 22 version
I would put TopBraid SPIN together with ARQ, rather than with the RDF and OWL tools, as it would only support a small fragment of OWL namely OWL 2 RL (and is as such not a full OWL reasoner).
Resolution:
Considered. I struggled with this, since SPIN isn&#39;t an OWL reasoner, and the others in the section are. The intent was to show there are other tools which can perform reasoning against RDF data, besides OWL reasoners. That is the specific purpose of Sparql, and it&#39;s included at that point in the document. Eric Schripsema

Section 9 &gt; Tools Recommended for Semantic Infrastructure Work &gt; Inference, Rules and Expert Systems &gt; General Purpose November 22 version
A section for pure rule reasoners seems to be missing (Jess and Drools are production rules engines), what is with reasoners such as Ontobroker (

</a>
), and others?
Resolution:
No intent to leave out any reasonable tool that can assist in the implementation.  The difficulty being finding mature, supported, functional tools.  If we could get some write ups as to how how to consider a specific tool conforms to standards or in other ways fits the problem, we can include them.
