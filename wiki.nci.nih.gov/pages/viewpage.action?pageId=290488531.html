<h3 id="id-20150512Retrospective6.4PhaseArchitect&amp;DesignSprint4-Whatdidwedowell?">
  What did we do well?
</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    All initially scoped items were completed early.
  </li>
  <li>
    Managed backlog and added items as we could to the scope.
  </li>
  <li>
    Tool usage is getting easier to manage tasks and subtasks.
  </li>
  <li>
    Feedback for OWL related issues was good by the NCI team.
  </li>
</ul>
<h3 id="id-20150512Retrospective6.4PhaseArchitect&amp;DesignSprint4-Whatshouldwehavedonebetter?">
  What should we have done better?
</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    Still have issues with GIT check-in process.
  </li>
  <li>
    Logging of hours - estimate updates for each sub task.  Need to be diligent and update prior to daily standup meeting.
  </li>
  <li>
    More structure to the daily standup - review the board and look at updates.
  </li>
  <li>
    Look at JIRA reporting to get better understand of how we are doing.
  </li>
  <li>
    Still need to develop a way to capture/plan capacity.
  </li>
  <li>
    Need to determine a better way to get feedback from the NCI team.   This could become a bottleneck as we need to keep moving forward.
  </li>
