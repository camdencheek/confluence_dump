session previously hosted by the program. Please find a brief overview (with links) below:
<ul>
  <li>
    Postdocs are usually up to five years at the NCI (sometimes longer depending on your field and goals). Things are still adjusting following COVID, and there still isn&#39;t a consensus on what the &#34;new normal&#34; will be. As such, everyone&#39;s experiences may be different for the next year or so.
  </li>
  <li>
    Stipends start at around $64,000 (which may vary depending on the division), and increase each year based as you gain additional research experience.
  </li>
  <li>
    Health insurance is provided to you at no cost, and includes medical, prescription, vision, and dental (provided by

    ). However, if you prefer your own health insurance, you can provide evidence of that instead.
