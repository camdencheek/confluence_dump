The Business Impact Analysis is used by business owners to capture the mission essential functions supported by their system, internal and external dependencies, and to document recovery metrics such as recovery time objective, recovery point objective, and maximum tolerable downtime. The BIA is part of the starter kit because it is tied closely to the FIPS-199 availability rating, and is now a required artifact of all system ATOs.
