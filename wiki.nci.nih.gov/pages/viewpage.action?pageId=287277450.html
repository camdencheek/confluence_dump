  Retrospective
</h2>
<h3 id="id-20150421Retrospective6.4PhaseArchitect&amp;DesignSprint3-Whatdidwedowell?">
  What did we do well?
</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    Better understanding of the Agile tool.  This included logging hours, commenting, moving tasks.
  </li>
  <li>
    NCI has better understanding of the Agile process.
  </li>
  <li>
    Reporting to NCI was better this time.   We have a consistent way to show our progress in a way that is reportable and repeatable.
  </li>
  <li>
    Team getting better at task estimates.
  </li>
  <li>
    Tasks were completed before the end of the sprint and additional tasks were then added.
  </li>
</ul>
<h3 id="id-20150421Retrospective6.4PhaseArchitect&amp;DesignSprint3-Whatshouldwehavedonebetter?">
  What should we have done better?
</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    Team needs to create sub-tasks when working on a multi step task.
  </li>
  <li>
    Should have provided more time with NCI to review our design and architecture documents.
  </li>
  <li>
    Need to have better access to NCI teams during the week to get more ready feedback. This will continue to be a problem and will impact the teams progress.
  </li>
  <li>
    Continue to keep focus on exit criteria as necessary. In many cases this will need to be provided in a clear and precise way from NCI.
  </li>
  <li>
    Continue to keep in mind the support process and JIRA prioritization with the team.
  </li>
</ul>
