b.  The last Use Case in the list, NanoParticle Ontology, starts off with “This is a scenario…”  Again, we need to clearly distinguish UCs, alternatives within them, and scenarios derived from them.


Resolution: The text and specific scenario were provided by the life sciences workspace, the SI team will revisit this section to determine if it adequately communicates the UC&#39;s. Raghu Chintalapati

Terminology – under the listing of Use Cases, specifically “High Throughput Sequencing using DNA…,” three variants, two sections on nanoparticle delivery systems, and five scenarios are listed. In UML modeling, the term scenario has a specific meaning within the context of a Use Case (UC). (It means a specific instance of a UC, or a specific path through a UC, if it has alternatives.) It is not clear what this collection of subtopics constitute or if they are all the same type of artifact. Are they alternatives for the overarching UC? If so, they should not be intermixed with Scenarios, if these really are scenarios in the UML sense. The fact that this UC is the only one that has subsections, and indeed it has ten of them, is probably telling us something about how this is structured and expressed.
