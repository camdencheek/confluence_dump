Comment on September 6 draft, consolidated from the input December 10
Use case 5 is &#34;Transform an ISO-11179 common data element to an HL7 V3 class object.&#34; The description talks about moving a form (not data elements) into HL7 CDA. This seems to conflate use case &#34;4.6.1 Users create forms to collect data for models and data elements that are already registered in the metadata repository&#34; and  &#34;4.6.4 Generate fillable form,&#34; when they are really very different things. It seems that existing content cannot be used directly in the new infrastructure.
Resolution:

Quoting from Use case 5, &#34;Now the user would like to move these forms to the HL7 CDA structure&#34; is the context of the use case, and &#34;The user would like to transform the CDEs to HL7 V3 class structures in order to get the full contextual meaning as used in the CDA document&#34; is the actual use case, i.e. the capability to automatically transform existing content (CDEs) to HL7 V3 class structures so that full contextual meaning of the form question can be specified in the HL7 V3 class structures, thus directly using existing content (CDEs) in the new infrastructure.
