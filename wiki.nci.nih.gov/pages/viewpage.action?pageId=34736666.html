Comment on November 22 Version
In the part about the &#34;linear value proposition&#34;, the last bullet says, &#34;Support for both ad hoc and distributed queries.&#34; This seems to imply that they are mutually exclusive alternatives, which they are not. If some stimulative definitions are being used, then they need to be clarified here or different terms should be used.
Resolution:

Section 2 &gt; Capability Big Buckets &gt; Composability  November 22 Version
The first sentence in this section either makes no commitments at all (any thing is potentially &#34;available&#34; for composition), or fails to constrain the problem of service composition so as to seem to drastically underestimate its complexity.
Resolution:
This text will become more specific as the Semantic Infrastructure project progresses in the next month. Charlie Mead

Section 2 &gt; Architecture Paradigm: Semantically-Aware Service-Oriented Architecture (sSOA)   November 22 Version
Unless the organizing principles, benefits and goals, and SOA design principles are specifically address later in the document, it seems to provide verily little value to include them here.
Resolution:
This is a convenient list for reference and will remain at least in the short term. If general agreement emerges on removing the list, it will be removed. Charlie Mead and Ann Wiley

Section 2 &gt; Service-Aware Interoperability Framework (SAIF)  November 22 Version
This section references a sub section of another document and says that it is key to understanding this document. That makes this document incoherant. This document should at least define the specific aspects that must be understand and clearly indicate how the SI v2 relates to them.
Resolution:
This section refers readers interested in specifics to the SAIF IG and suggests sections of the SAIG IG that may of particular interest and states why. No change is being made at this time. Ann Wiley

Section 2 &gt; Additional Information about Use of sSOA and SAIF  November 22 Version
This links to another page which doesn&#39;t provide substantially more information. If you follow the link to CBIIT Implementation Guide, you see that it is based on the four frameworks which is says are defined in the HL7 Book. If you click on that, you get to some directory on the HL7 GForge which appears to contain a bunch of notes and draft documents, none of which is named &#34;HL7 Book&#34;. That is quite confusing to an outside observer and seems to indicate that this work is not based on a well-defined conceptual foundation (which you would expect to find in the HL7 Book).
Resolution:
Charlie Mead will provide the correct link. Issue resolved. Ann Wiley
