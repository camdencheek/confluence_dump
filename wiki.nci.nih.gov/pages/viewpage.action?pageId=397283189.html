  First-Time Login and Set-up Steps
</h1>
Upon initial login to CTRP STRAP, you will be required to answer a few security related questions for identification verification purposes.  Detailed description of the steps that will be necessary are below.  For existing CTRP STRAP users, the change in authentication service will have minor impact, as your username and password remain the same. To access CTRP STRAP after the Okta transition:
<ol>
  <li>
    Click on the Acknowledge and Continue button on the  login screen.

    Choose the method you would like to use by clicking the ‘Setup’ button directly under your choice.
  </li>
  <li>
    The following sections of this document define the steps needed for each of the different methods. Please see the section that correlates to your authentication choice. Note: You may choose more than one authentication method. For example, this provides you the opportunity to connect your account with your cell phone (Okta Verify app) and your office phone (Voice Call Authentication), even if they are two different numbers. Please see the section entitled “Two Factor Option: Multiple Methods”.
  </li>
  <li>
    Once you have completed the setup for your chosen authentication method, click on the ‘Finish’ button.
  </li>
  <li>
    Next, you will see a window asking you to choose a forgot password question. Please choose a question and enter your answer. This will only be used to verify your identity prior to starting the recover password process, if necessary.

    The next time you click on the Acknowledge and Continue button of CTRP STRAP, you will see the initial login screen again asking for your username. Once you enter your username and click “Next”, you will see a security image above the password textbox. This security image provides extra verification that you are accessing the correct page and account. This image is randomly selected when your account is activated but should be the same each time you enter your username. (If you ever see an unfamiliar image, do not enter your password.

  Two-Factor : Multiple Methods
</h1>
It is possible to set up more than one of the authentication methods. While only one method is needed for each login, and each type authentication may only be associated with one phone number, this configuration allows some flexibility for users who want the option of using two different phone numbers.Here are some examples of how this might be used: - Okta Verify Authentication (cell phone), Voice Call Authentication (office phone).User sets up Okta Verify authentication to send pushes to their cell phone and sets up Voice Call Authentication to their office phone number. If the user does not have cell service in their office, they can use their office phone to authenticate, and they can authenticate via Okta Verify push on their cell phone if they are away from their office. - SMS Authentication (personal cell phone), Okta Verify Authentication (work cell phone).User sets up Okta Verify Authentication to send pushes their company-issued cell phone and sets up SMS Authentication to their personal cell phone. The user does not wish to install an app on their personal cell phone, but would like to have a backup method of authentication in case of any changes to their work cell phone number.- Okta Verify Authentication (cell phone), SMS Authentication (cell phone), Voice Call Authentication (office phone).User wishes to have several methods for authentication, especially since their day-to-day schedule is extremely varied. This allows the user to choose the method that best suits their situation at login time.

    Determine the configuration that best fits your situation and decide which of the authentication methods that you want to use and which phone number you want to use with each.
  </li>
  <li>
    Follow the earlier instructions in this document for the first login. When you get to the point of choosing an authentication method, select the first method on your list. Follow the instructions in this document for that method and connect it to your chosen phone number and complete the verification.
