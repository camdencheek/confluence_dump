Section 5 &gt; Conformance Testing
Service registries are mentioned separate from the artifact registry; where is this defined (not before this point it seems?); I had the impression that the artifact registry also serves as a service registry.


Resolution: Service registry is a platform component. Artifact registry and service specification registry is a SI component. The artifact registry does not serve as the service registry, the service registry has all the runtime information about the service. Raghu Chintalapati
