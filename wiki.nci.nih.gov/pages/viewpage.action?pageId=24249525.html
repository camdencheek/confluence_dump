        Summary of requirement pre-interview, by Reviewer:
      </td>
      <td>
        There is a distinct need to reduce the cost, time, and resources in general for the loading of models/metadata into the metadata repository.  It is currently a manual process performed by Metadata Curators at NCI, which is currently and will continue to be a bottleneck.  One possible way to streamline the approach is to use a workflow tool out-of-the-box to manage the metadata creation, submission, storage, review, and acceptance.  One such product is
        <a href="http://www.intalio.com/products/bpm/community-edition/" rel="nofollow">
          Italio
        </a>
        , which allows processes to be documented and implemented using BPM.  This would allow Software Engineers and Information Modelers to manage the loading process themselves.

        Note: this requirement overlaps with
