  Overview
</h1>
The NCI Information System Security Officer (ISSO) is part of the review process for acquisitions to evaluate if federal cybersecurity (FISMA, FedRAMP, etc.) language needs to be included in the statement of work (SOW) for an upcoming request for proposal (RFP).To complete this review there are three steps:
<ol>
  <li>
    Completing the pre-solicitation questionnaire in the RFP development process.
  </li>
  <li>
    Completing the pre-solicitation checklist and review process prior to the RFP being released.
  </li>
  <li>
    Completing the pre-award checklist and review process prior to the contract being awarded.
  </li>
</ol>

  Pre-solicitation Questionnaire
</h2>
The pre-solicitation questionnaire gathers the required information for an upcoming RFP for the ISSO, to they can best assist the CO/COR in developing requirements for security.Please see the link to the ISSO Pre-solicitation Questionnaire below:

  Pre-solicitation Review

In doing the Pre-sol review, the NCI ISSO makes determinations if:
<ul>
  <li>
    The acquisition involves one or more information technology (IT) systems
  </li>
  <li>
    If there is an IT system(s) involved, will it be a Federal system?
    <ul>
      <li>
        If there is a federal system involved, it will be subject to FISMA requirements
        <ul>
          <li>
            Answers what kind of data will the system create, process, store, transmit, or receive?
          </li>
          <li>
            Determines preliminary categorization (impact level) of either Low, Moderate, or High
          </li>
          <li>
            Where will the system be hosted?
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        If not, then no FISMA requirements apply, and the review is complete
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

  Pre-award Review
</h2>
The purpose of the pre-award review is for the ISSO to look at winning bidder’s proposal to confirm that the awardee acknowledges the security work required by the contract and the awardee addresses how they are going to meet these requirements in a realistic, timely, and satisfactory manner.Please see the link to the ISSO Pre-award Checklist below:
