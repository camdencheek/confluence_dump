  What did we do well?
</h3>

  <li>
    Working in Agile as our first time.

  <li>
    Learned a lot out the tool (Jira)

  <li>
    Tasks were completed on time.
  </li>
  <li>
    First at story points, will help establish velocity.
  </li>
  <li>

  </li>
</ul>
<h3 id="id-20150407Retrospective6.4PhaseArchitect&amp;DesignSprint2-Whatshouldwehavedonebetter?">
  What should we have done better?
</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    Needed to have better exit criteria.
  </li>
  <li>
    Need to have full team acceptance of Agile
  </li>
  <li>
    Too much focus on methodology and tooling, instead of the work to be done.
  </li>
  <li>
    Estimates weren&#39;t done well - some easier/faster than other.
  </li>
  <li>
    Missing the to capture Capacity - what each team member could work (hours).
  </li>
  <li>
    Assignment of stories/tasks was random. Mostly based on experience and who we thought should do certain tasks.
  </li>
  <li>
    Need to correctly break down epics into stories and tasks before we start the sprint.
  </li>
  <li>
    Need to determine a good of reporting to NCI and team for progress.  (aside from agile board).
  </li>
  <li>
    Stand-ups need to include review of agile board and have team update work log prior to the standup.
  </li>

    to discus with NCI the support process and how things will be prioritized.
    <ul>
      <li>
        Sprint has a limit to a certain amount of time for support (8 hours/week).  This will include JIRA items identified to be include in Sprint.  If there is capacity in the sprint (support category), then we can include in current sprint.  Issues/requests to be captured in JIRA so we can track and assign.
      </li>
      <li>
        If critical, then Larry can over-rule and the sprint will be jeopardized.
