Section 5 &gt; caGRID 2.0 Platform and Terminology Integration &gt; Service Generation November 22 version
Service generation is defined as the ability to generate services from user defined service metadata. I think this is too ambitious, what kind of data should the user provide such that you will generate a service? This seems more something like Service discovery: based on the user defined requirements for a service you present the user with a set of services that satisfy these requirements.


Resolution: User defined service metadata refers to service specifications and other service artifacts like WSDLs. The SI team is working to define specific profiles that can be applied to existing ECCF specification artifacts; these profiles to are intended to make the artifacts computable, allowing the SI to extract service metadata from these artifacts.

Data Representation and Information Model
How does this fit in with the artifact management, are these information models seen as static models managed as an artifact?


Resolution: Yes. Artifacts management include management of any model. Raghu Chintalapati
