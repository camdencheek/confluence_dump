  New Features and Updates
</h2>
Highlights of this patch release are:
<ul>
  <li>
    Concurrency management in Run Time Classification
  </li>
  <li>
    Increased Performance of the Prompt User tab
  </li>
</ul>
This patch release for version 1.2.3 of the Protege NICEditTab plugin was targeted towards increasing the performance of the Run Time Classification (RTC). The change is entirely in the infrastructure. The RTC in the current release synchronizes its data against the Protege server rather than the Protege client, thereby eliminating network latency issues affecting all users (but with a larger impact on remote users).
<ul>
  <li>
    Also, a performance enhancement has been done in Prompt: an inefficient lookup algorithm has been replaced with a solution that involves caching of data instead.
  </li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>
    In addition to the patch release of the software, a Citrix server has been set up and already deployed to reduce connectivity issues affecting remote users. The Citrix server is currently supporting NCIT editing, but it will be expanded to support BGT editing in the future.
  </li>
</ul>

  Known Issues
</h2>
NoteA number of bug reports involved irreproducible items that have now been identified as originating in the software components that deal with database transactions. Because of the amount of work involved to correct this, this patch release does not include fixes for these bugs, they have been scoped for version 1.3 of the software.

To minimize the likelihood of these transaction issues occurring:
<ol>
  <li>
    When saving a concept, users need to click OK on the notification dialog that is displayed when the Save is successful when it first pops up, e.g. try not to take a break from editing until the OK dialog has been clicked.
  </li>
  <li>
    If a &#34;create class&#34; action fails, do not attempt to execute it again right away, you can attempt it on your next login.
  </li>
</ol>
