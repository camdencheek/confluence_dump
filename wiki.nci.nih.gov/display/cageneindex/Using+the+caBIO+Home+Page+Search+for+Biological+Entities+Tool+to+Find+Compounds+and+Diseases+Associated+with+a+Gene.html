To Print the GuideWe recommend you print one wiki page of the guide at a time. To do this, click the printer icon at the top right of the page; then from the browser File menu, choose Print. Printing multiple pages at one time is more complex. For instructions, refer to How do I print multiple pages?.
Having Trouble Reading the Text?Resizing the text for any web page is easy. For information on how to do this in your web browser, refer to this

The
<a href="http://cabioapi.nci.nih.gov/cabio43/Home.action" rel="nofollow">
  caBIO Home Page Search for Biological Entities
</a>
is a flexible tool, and the workflow presented here is just one of the ways that it can be used. These steps illustrate how to query a specific type of Cancer Gene Index-associated object to identify those with attributes that are associated with your gene search term.
<h1 id="UsingthecaBIOHomePageSearchforBiologicalEntitiesTooltoFindCompoundsandDiseasesAssociatedwithaGene-IdentifyingaGeneSearchTerm">
  Identifying a Gene Search Term
</h1>
In order to search for genes that are associated with a given disease, you must first have a
<a href="http://www.genenames.org" rel="nofollow">
  HUGO gene symbol
</a>
<a href="http://www.cancer.gov/policies/linking" rel="nofollow">
  <img alt="Exit Disclaimer logo" src="https://wiki.nci.nih.gov/download/attachments/embedded-page/wikicontent/Exit%20Disclaimer%20to%20Include/exit_small.png?api=v2">
</a>
. Although it is much easier to use the HUGO gene symbol, you may also use the gene&#39;s NCI Thesaurus concept code. To find this code, navigate to the
<a href="http://nciterms.nci.nih.gov/" rel="nofollow">
  NCI Thesaurus web page
</a>
and select the Contains radio button (1). Enter you gene symbol (2) and click the Search button (3). If you cannot find the term for which you were looking, click on the Contact Us link at the bottom of the web page (4).

TipYou may use the question mark wild card character after your search term (for example, &#34;top2?&#34;) when using Exact Match or Begins With.

Select the desired result from the list of retrieved thesaurus terms in order to view the term&#39;s concept page. You may use Thesaurus Code (1) with the Search for Biological Entities tool.
<h1 id="UsingthecaBIOHomePageSearchforBiologicalEntitiesTooltoFindCompoundsandDiseasesAssociatedwithaGene-UsingtheSearchforBiologicalEntitiesTool">
  Using the Search for Biological Entities Tool
</h1>
Compounds and diseases associated with a particular gene in the Cancer Gene Index data may be accessed by selecting the Gene class in the package gov.nih.nci.cabio.domain. The line breaks in the tree represent classes that have been removed for space. Enter the HUGO gene symbol in the symbol field or the NCI Thesaurus gene concept code in the id field, select gov.nih.nci.cabio.domain.GeneFunctionAssociation as the Search Object, and click Submit. Retrieved results are shown as records in Gene/Agent and Gene/Disease tables.

TipAlthough the Cancer Gene Index refers to pharmacological substances by the term &#34;compound&#34; or even &#34;drug,&#34; caBIO and the NCI Thesaurus use the term &#34;agent&#34; for this concept.

To view the sentence and annotation information, select the getEvidenceCollection method (green box in top panel) to call up the associated Evidence type object (green box in middle panel). For additional information on these data and metadata, refer to the

section.

Search TipIf you do not want to spend time navigating through the caBIO object model for candidate gene-compound associations that were found to be false positives, you should first view the Evidence objects (bottom panel) and scroll to the right to check that the

Click the getAgent method link to the name and EVS identifier of the associated compound term in the fullName and EVSid columns, respectively.

Click the getDiseaseOntology method link to the name and EVS identifier of the associated disease term in the fullName and EVSid columns, respectively.  You may also view parent and child concepts for your disease of interest and explore gene-disease associations with those disease concepts, as well (2). Black double lines indicated breaks in the view of an object in this figure. You can find parent disease concepts by scrolling to the right and selecting the getParentDiseaseOntologyRelationshipCollection link; child disease concepts can be accessed by clicking on the getChildDiseaseOntologyRelationshipCollection link.
