To Print the GuideWe recommend you print one wiki page of the guide at a time. To do this, click the printer icon at the top right of the page; then from the browser File menu, choose Print. Printing multiple pages at one time is more complex. For instructions, refer to How do I print multiple pages?.

tool allows end users to execute case-insensitive searches for the diseases and compounds that are associated with a gene concept. These search terms must match exact gene terms in the Cancer Gene Index.

If you would like to search for a specific gene (for example, only for &#34;BMP7&#34;), you may use the gene&#39;s

.

If you would like to search for diseases and compounds that are associated with a related genes (for example, &#34;BMP2,&#34; &#34;BMP3,&#34; &#34;BMP5&#34;, and &#34;BMP7&#34;), use the * wild card character, which matches zero or more characters, in your search terms (for example, &#34;BMP*&#34;). For example, a search for &#34;bmp7&#34; will return nearly 210 results that are related to that exact term, whereas a search for &#34;bmp*&#34; returns nearly 2,200 results, where genes match terms that include &#34;BMP1,&#34; &#34;BMP2,&#34; and &#34;BMPR2.&#34;

  Using Templated Search Tool to Retrieve Gene-Disease and Gene-Compound Concept Pairs
</h1>
To search for Cancer Gene Index gene-disease and gene-compound data on the Templated Search page, click on the Cancer Gene Index Category node (1) and choose the Gene to Diseases/Agents query option (2). Manually delete the suggested search term &#34;C4BPA&#34; (3), enter your compound term or concept code into the text box (for example, &#34;BMP7&#34; or &#34;BMP*&#34;), and click the Search button (4).

NoteAlthough the Cancer Gene Index refers to pharmacological substances as &#34;compounds,&#34; caBIO refers to the concept as &#34;agents.&#34;
<img alt="Portlet GeneSearch" src="https://wiki.nci.nih.gov/download/attachments/embedded-page/cageneindex/Using%20the%20caBIO%20Portlet%20Templated%20Search%20to%20Find%20Diseases%20and%20Compounds%20Associated%20with%20a%20Gene/PortletGeneSearch.jpg?api=v2">
The Gene to Diseases/Agents query returns Gene/Agent Association and Gene/Disease Association results in a tabular form. Each table consists of three columns which include: HUGO Gene Symbol, NCI Thesaurus disease or compound term, and a PubMed identifier. Each row represents a single gene-disease or gene-compound association. You will will receive a &#34;No results found&#34; message if you have used a search term that does not match any Cancer Gene Index gene symbol or if no disease or compound is associated with your gene search term.

Warning!Your first result page will likely contain a Gene/Agent Association and Gene/Disease Association table. This does not mean that all of the gene-compound associations are given on the first page. Instead you must continue to review subsequent results pages to find all gene-compound and gene-disease association results.
