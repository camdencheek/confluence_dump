as of December 2009, and this number is rapidly increasing. Scientists cannot manually identify all known cancer genes, and it is even more difficult to uncover the relationships between these genes and various human cancers, for example. In theory, one could exhaustively search PubMed and compile a list of the genes related to a given disease or compound, but this would take many weeks, and it is highly likely that such a manual search would still miss some genes and relationships. The National Cancer Institute (NCI) recognized that a publicly-available resource that combined these gene-disease and gene-compound data with relevant annotations would greatly facilitate research, and as part of its
<a href="http://cabig.cancer.gov/" rel="nofollow">
  caBIG® initiative
</a>
, it created the Cancer Gene Index Project.The goal of the Cancer Gene Index is to further translational cancer research by providing a high quality data resource consisting of genes that have been experimentally associated with human cancer diseases and/or pharmacological compounds, the evidence of these associations, and relevant annotations on the data. Thus, scientists can use the data resource to quickly discover and evaluate all of the genes associated with a disease, all of the genes associated with a compound, or all of the diseases and compounds associated with a gene. This extremely valuable resource was created through a unique process that coupled automated linguistic text analysis of millions of

abstracts with manual validation and annotation of the extracted data by expert human curators. Details on this process are found in the section
<a href="https://wiki.nci.nih.gov/x/DS9yAQ" rel="nofollow">
  Creation of the Cancer Gene Index
</a>
.The Cancer Gene Index includes data on 6,955 unique human genes, nearly 12,000 NCI Thesaurus cancer disease terms, and 2,180 unique pharmacological compounds from the NCI Thesaurus. The gene-disease and gene-compound associations were extracted from over 92 million analyzed sentences of nearly 20 million abstracts. The resource was last updated in June, 2009.

  Means of Accessing Cancer Gene Index Data
</h1>
The Cancer Gene Index is available as computer-readable Gene-Disease and Gene-Compound data files. To effectively use these files, you must be a bioinformaticist or computer programmer-scientist, or you must collaborate with someone who has this expertise. Ideally, intuitive graphical user interfaces (GUIs) would allow all scientists to quickly and easily access these data and exploit the full power of the Cancer Gene Index. Already,

interfaces, on the other hand, expose all of the Cancer Gene Index data, and these can give you an appreciation for the full potential of the data resource. Many of these interfaces, however, require more experience with computer programming than the average bench scientist may have. Data within caBIO may be programmatically accessed through a variety of Application Programming Interfaces (APIs). The caBIO GUIs include the

    If you have limited knowledge of the caBIO object model and caBIG®, you should use the Cancer Gene Index Gene-Disease and Gene-Compound XML documents with the

    . The format of these documents is extremely simple, making them very easy with which to work. To download the XML documents, you must have a computer with at least 720 MB of free disk space, an internet connection, and a web browser; other system requirements depend upon the way in which you intend to use the data resource.

  Examples of How the Cancer Gene Index Facilitates Translational Research
</h1>
The Cancer Gene Index can facilitate many different types of cancer research. Two examples are given below.
<h2 id="CancerGeneIndexEndUserDocumentation-TranslationalMedicineResearch">
  Translational Medicine Research
</h2>
In this first example from the
<a href="https://cabig.nci.nih.gov/09_Annual_Meeting/2009_caBIG_Annual_Meeting_Posters.pdf" rel="nofollow">
  Cancer Gene Index Project poster
</a>
, the data resource is used to validate colon cancer translational medicine research data. Here, scientists have obtained access to deidentified demographic data, histopathology data (lymph node [ICR:pN], tumor size [ICR:pT], and degree of metastasis [ICR:G]), and tumor tissue biospecimens from patients, which are represented by gray figures. The scientists perform gene expression microarrays on each colon cancer biospecimen (pink and red colon tissue cells). The genes (purple DNA fragments) with significantly altered expression are validated by cross-referencing the Cancer Gene Index.

<h2 id="CancerGeneIndexEndUserDocumentation-BiomarkerDiscovery">
  Biomarker Discovery
</h2>
The Cancer Gene Index also may be used for lymphoma biomarker discovery. This example from the
<a href="https://cabig.nci.nih.gov/09_Annual_Meeting/2009_caBIG_Annual_Meeting_Posters.pdf" rel="nofollow">
  Cancer Gene Index Project poster
</a>
illustrates that researchers can use the data resource to quickly identify the genes (purple DNA fragments) that are associated with and may be biomarkers for Lymphoma. Here, gene-disease concept pair associations are shown as blue &#34;to diseases&#34; arrows. By searching the Cancer Gene Index for therapeutic compounds that are associated with these genes, scientists easily uncover which of these candidate disease biomarkers are also associated with lymphoma-related compounds. An association between the gene encoding SPN, also known as sialophorin or CD43, and the compound leflunomide is represented by a black &#34;has validated association with&#34; arrow. Cancer Gene Index data can be cross-referenced to other resources, such as the clinical trial protocol database
<a href="http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/pdq" rel="nofollow">
  Physician Data Query® (PDQ)
</a>
to obtain information about trials that link these data.
