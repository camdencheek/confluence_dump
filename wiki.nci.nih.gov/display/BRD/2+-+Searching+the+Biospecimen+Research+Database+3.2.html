  Search Overview
</h2>
You can search the Biospecimen Research Database (BRD) to find research papers and studies that match criteria you specify. Each published paper is associated with one or more studies that address specific experimental questions. If you do not narrow your search by selecting search criteria, then all studies in the database will be returned as search results.You can search the BRD in the following ways.

The home page also contains a News and Announcements section, a Featured Paper identified by a BRD Curator, and lists of papers that have been added recently as well as those that were recently viewed by you. A Twitter feed from the NCI Biospecimens account is also displayed. If you want to share information on the BRD, compose a new tweet via your personal Twitter account using the #BRD hashtag.

Located in the top right portion of the header on every BRD page, is a keyword search box labeled Search BRD Papers.  You can search very quickly for any paper in the BRD by using any keyword including paper information, authors, free text, biospecimen location or type, or pre-analytical factor.The Simple Search is highlighted in red in the screenshot below.

The Browse by Analyte search option displays the contents of the BRD in a table that is organized by both the analyte investigated and the biospecimen type and location used for analysis. The numbers within the table contain links to search results that correspond to the biospecimen type/location and analyte selected.  From the Search Results page, you can toggle between results for other analytes for a given biospecimen type and location without the need to return to the Browse by Analyte page. For more information, see

  Browse by Pre-analytical Factor Overview
</h3>
The Browse by Pre-analytical Factor search option displays the contents of the BRD in a table that is organized by the experimental questions addressed (pre-analytical factor) and the biospecimen type/location used for analysis. Due to the large number of pre-analytical factors captured by the BRD, the table can be restricted by selecting a Classification or directly entering a pre-analytical factor. The number links in the table represent all of the relevant papers in the BRD for the corresponding pre-analytical factor listed in the row.  For more information, see

  Conducting a Simple Search
</h2>
You can conduct a Simple Search for a paper from any BRD page. Enter any keyword associated with the area of interest (such as a tissue type, diagnosis, biomarker, fixative, anticoagulant, and so on) or a specific paper (such as the PubMed ID, title, journal, year, and so on). N ote that gene symbol use within the BRD is not standardized and it is recommended that you search using the full gene name. Also, if you are searching for a specific author, use the Author(s) search option on the
<a href="https://wiki.nci.nih.gov/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=277282966" rel="nofollow">

 page.   Specificity can be increased by including multiple words with or without search operators. If using multiple search operators, use parentheses to control query logic. Search operators that are supported by Simple Search, example queries, and their anticipated results are summarized in the table below.

    To make your search more specific, you may opt to select the Limit search to experimental comparisons box. This limits the search fields to Pre-analytical Factors and their values. For example, if you entered the term biopsy as a keyword and you limited your search to experimental comparisons, the search results would immediately refresh to show you only those papers in which biopsy was compared to other biospecimen procurement methods.

  Conducting an Advanced Search
</h2>
An Advanced Search of the Biospecimen Research Database provides you with the most control over search criteria and results in comparison to other search options.When specifying search criteria in the Biospecimen Research Database, there are no required fields. You can add as much detail or only those criteria that you consider essential to the search. You can also select multiple search terms in the same list by selecting the first item, pressing and holding Ctrl, and then selecting the next item(s). If you don&#39;t specify any criteria, all entries in the BRD appear in the search results.If a paper you are looking for is not in the BRD, you can

<ol>
  <li>
    Click Advanced Search, which is located under the Search tab. The Advanced Search page appears.
    <img alt="Advanced Search page" width="700" src="https://wiki.nci.nih.gov/download/attachments/embedded-page/BRD/2%20-%20Searching%20the%20Biospecimen%20Research%20Database%203.2/AdvancedSearch.png?api=v2">
  </li>
  <li>
    For maximum search accuracy, specify search criteria by clicking items in the lists.
    <ul>
      <li>
        To select multiple fields in the same list, click the first field, press and hold the CTRL key, and then click additional fields. The fields you select are highlighted and your search results contain all studies matching any of the fields. For example, if you select both the Cell and Fluid biospecimen types, your search results contain all studies that concern either cells or fluid.
      </li>
      <li>
        When you select fields from different lists, you narrow your search. For example, if you select the Cell biospecimen type and the Kidney biospecimen location, your search results include studies that concern both cells and kidneys.Note that the selections you make in the lists on the left determine the selections in the lists on the right. For example, selecting the Biospecimen Type “Fluid” makes “Blood” an available Biospecimen Location.The following table describes the Advanced Search criteria.

Each paper includes one or more associated studies. Studies are defined as the set(s) of experiments within a paper that investigate different pre-analytical factors, use different analytical platforms for analysis, or explore different biospecimen sample sets. For example, a paper that examines the effect of a biospecimen handling variable on RNA and protein analysis may have two studies in the database, one study describing the results of RNA analysis and one describing the results of protein mass spectroscopy analysis. On the Paper Details page, you can:
