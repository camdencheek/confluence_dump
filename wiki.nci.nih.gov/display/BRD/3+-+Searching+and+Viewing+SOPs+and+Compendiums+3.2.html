An SOP provides instructions for a process for which uniformity in performance are optimal and sometimes required. In BRD, SOP types are organized hierarchically, with progression to a higher level representing the work invested and the confidence the Biorepositories and Biospecimen Research Branch (BBRB) has in the document. From lowest to highest, SOPs progress through the following levels: SOP, Biospecimen Evidence-Based Practices, and Expert-vetted.SOPs are version-controlled. Each time a new version is available in the BRD, the SOP receives a new unique identifier, called a BRD ID, allowing you to clearly identify differences between SOPs that may have clinical and scientific implications.SOPs are available to the public. To provide comments on specific SOP versions, register with

  Searching for an SOP
</h2>
You can search for SOPs by keyword or by selecting a curated field.When searching for an SOP, there are no required fields. You can add as much detail or only those criteria that you consider essential to the search. You can also select multiple search terms in the same list by selecting the first item, pressing and holding Ctrl, and then selecting the next item(s).If you don&#39;t specify any criteria, all SOPs appear in the search results. To search for SOPs
<ol>
  <li>
    Select Search &gt; Search SOPs.The Search SOPs page appears.
    <img alt="search SOPs page" width="600" src="https://wiki.nci.nih.gov/download/attachments/embedded-page/BRD/3%20-%20Searching%20and%20Viewing%20SOPs%20and%20Compendiums%203.2/SOP%20search.png?api=v2">
  </li>
  <li>
    For maximum search accuracy, specify search criteria by clicking items in the lists.
    <ul>
      <li>
        To select multiple fields in the same list, click the first field, press and hold the CTRL key, and then click additional fields. The fields you select are highlighted and your search results contain all SOPs matching any of the fields. For example, if you select both the Cell and Fluid biospecimen types, your search results contain all SOPs that concern either cells or fluid.
      </li>
      <li>
        When you select fields from different lists, you narrow your search. For example, if you select the Cell biospecimen type and the Kidney biospecimen location, your search results include SOPs  that concern both cells and kidneys.The following table describes the SOP search criteria.Note that the selections you make in the lists on the left determine the selections in the lists on the right. For example, selecting the Biospecimen Type “Fluid” makes “Blood” an available Biospecimen Location.

  Understanding Versioning
</h2>
Any time the BRD curation team updates an SOP or a Compendium, a new version of that SOP or Compendium is created with a unique BRD-ID. The most recent versions of the SOP or Compendium are displayed by default. Differences may exist between versions that have clinical and scientific implications.Before you download an SOP or a Compendium, confirm that you have selected the correct version, if applicable. Versions are associated with a release date.The following is an SOP version list:
