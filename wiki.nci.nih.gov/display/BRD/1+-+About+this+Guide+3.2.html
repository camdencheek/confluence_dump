The Biospecimen Research Database (BRD) is an initiative of the Biospecimen Research Network (BRN) program. BRD is a free and publicly accessible database that contains peer-reviewed literature pertinent to the field of human Biospecimen Science. The database is updated daily with both recent and historical publications and may serve as a vehicle for literature review, evaluation of &#34;in use&#34; biospecimen handling protocols, development of new protocols, and identification of analytes that are susceptible or impervious to handling variability. BRD paper entries include primary research or review articles that have been identified, reviewed, and curated by a Ph.D.-level scientist.This guide explains how to search the BRD and use the new features included in version 3.2.
