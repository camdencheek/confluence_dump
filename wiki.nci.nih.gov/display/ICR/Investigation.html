  Description
</h2>
The ISA-TAB-Nano investigation file leverages the ISA-TAB investigation file, and it allows for the description of the primary investigation and associated studies including assays and protocols. An investigation can have one or more studies. For example, an investigation titled “Dendrimer-Based MRI Contrast Agents” may have two studies titled as “Characterizing the Size of Dendrimer based MRI Contrast Agents” and “Determining the cytotoxicity property of Dendrimer based MRI Contrast Agents in porcine proximal tubule cells” Each study can have one or more assays depending on the endpoint measured and the technique used. For example, a cytoxicity study may be conducted using an MTT assay and a LDH release assay. While a size characterization study can include two types of assays based on the technique used – one using DLS and the other using AFM.The ISA-TAB specification provides flexibility in representing the level of granularity in information associated with a study; however, the level of granularity should factor in the effective representation of assays and protocols in conformance with the specification. For example, a study focusing on “Size Characterizations” will have multiple size measurements (for example, Z-average size, hydrodynamic size) and may involve the use of multiple techniques (for example, size by DLS, size by AFM). These can be represented effectively in the ISA-TAB file structure that ISA-TAB-Nano uses.The investigation file provides descriptive information about studies including design descriptors, publications, factors, assays, protocols, and contacts. This descriptive information lays the foundation for other ISA-TAB-Nano files. For example, the following table shows a subset of the Investigation File, which is the study factors section of the investigation file. This section provides the names of factors (for example, temperature, solvent medium) used in the study and their associated units of measurement (if the factors are quantitative). The values of these factors (for example, PBS, 25 Celsius) are specified either in the study or the assay file.
<h2 id="Investigation-FileFormat">
  File Format
</h2>
The ISA-TAB-Nano investigation file leverages the ISA-TAB file format, which is a vertical-based spreadsheet format with row headers in the first column, as shown in the following table. The fields are divided into sections. Therefore, the field values in the investigation file are entered in column order. For instance, in the following table, Column A indicates the field names and Columns B and C contain the field values.Example Subset of the Investigation File Format
