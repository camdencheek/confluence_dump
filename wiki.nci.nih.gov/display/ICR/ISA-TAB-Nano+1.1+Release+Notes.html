  New Features
</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    Modified the ISA-TAB-Nano 1.0 version to address user comments. Modifications include:
  </li>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Addition of a MATERIAL section in the ISA-TAB Investigation File to reference the Material File Name and Material Source Name. Removal of Material File in the Study File.
    </li>
    <li>
      Removal of a separate field in the ISA-TAB Assay File to capture Statistics. Users should reference the Statistic in the Measurement Value parameter name in brackets (e.g., Measurement Value [Mean (diameter)]”).
    </li>
  </ul>
  <li>
    Enforced the following business rule:
    <ol>
      <li>
        If the assay is a physico-chemical characterization, there should be no study factors of Study Factor Type nanoparticle sample
      </li>
      <li>
        If the assay is a biological assay (in vitro, in vivo), the Study Factor Name and type must be of nanoparticle sample if the assay is applying a nanoparticle sample to a biological system.
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
</ul>

  Fixes
</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    Fixed ISA-TAB-Nano Investigation File examples to use a prefix for Term Accession Number and Term Source REF in the Investigation File per the ISA-TAB specification (not required for other ISA-TAB files)
  </li>
  <li>
    Fixed ISA-TAB-Nano Study File examples to follow the appropriate ISA-TAB ordering requirements
    <ul>
      <li>
        In the Study File, order Protocol REF and associated parameters immediately after Source Name and associated attributes and before Sample Name and Factor Values
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    Fixed ISA-TAB-Nano Assay File examples to follow the appropriate ISA-TAB ordering requirements
    <ul>
      <li>
        In the Assay File, order Protocol REF to be included after Sample Name
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    Fixed ISA-TAB-Nano Assay File examples to remove the Source Name.  Only the Sample Name should be referenced in the Assay File.
  </li>
</ul>

  Known Issues and Workarounds
</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    Currently, ISA-TAB does not support Study Grant Number and Study Funding Agency as standard fields in the Investigation Files. These fields can be added in a comments field.
  </li>
  <li>
    Grouping of assays is subjective to the particular study. Recommend grouping of assays that use the same sample under one study.
  </li>
  <li>
    For studies involving insertion of tumor cells into mice and the application of a nanoparticle as a treatment, the tumor cells should be parameter values and the nanoparticle should be factor values.
  </li>
</ul>
