Am I able to change the default port number 38080 to another port, for example, 80 after the installation of caArray? Do I just change the port number in the install property file and start up the server again?

The caArray HTTP port number can be changed in the file:



&lt;caArray installation home&gt;/jboss-4.0.5.GA/server/default/conf/bindings.xml



following the steps below:
<ol>
  <li>
    Shut down the JBoss server.
  </li>
  <li>
    Open the file &lt;caArray installation home&gt;/jboss-4.0.5.GA/server/default/conf/bindings.xml in a text editor.
  </li>
  <li>
    Search and replace all instances of the current port number with the desired port number.
  </li>
  <li>
    Save and restart JBoss.
  </li>
</ol>
Re-running your installer is not necessary, since it could remove all the data in the database from current installation.
