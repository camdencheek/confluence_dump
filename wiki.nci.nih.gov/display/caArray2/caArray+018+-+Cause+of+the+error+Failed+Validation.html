I was importing MAGE-TAB array data files and related annotation files, but my .srdf file received an error message as &#34;Failed Validation&#34;. Why?

In caArray, many types of files can be uploaded, but not all files can be validated. The validation process is only for the data files associated with experimental samples, such as: array design files, array data files, and array annotation files (

</a>
. The validation process may occur implicitly (array design file) or explicitly (all other array-related annotation or data files).File validation verifies if the data content adheres to a certain format. It does not evaluate the accuracy of the data from scientific viewpoint. A validation error can be structural or content-based. Validation can fail for one or more of the following reasons:
<ul>
  <li>
    Format unknown (Errors are based on file extension and array type)
  </li>
  <li>
    Reference file not found (e.g. array data file is listed in MAGE-TAB .SDRF, but not uploaded)
  </li>
  <li>
    File incomplete
  </li>
  <li>
    Vocabulary failure (annotation terms has to be in supported ontology and declared in .IDF file)
  </li>
</ul>
If a file fails to be validated, this file can not be imported into caArray, unless the:
<ol>
  <li>
    Error is fixed
  </li>
  <li>
    Validation process is bypassed by changing file type
  </li>
  <li>
    Import process is bypassed by uploading the file as a supplemental file
  </li>
</ol>
