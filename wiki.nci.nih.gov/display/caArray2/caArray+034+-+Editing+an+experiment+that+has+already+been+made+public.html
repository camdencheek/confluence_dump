Users can regain control of an experiment that has been made public. However, in order to do so, users must first retract the experiment to the work queue.The illustrations below show the the workflow for making an experiment public and then retracting the experiment for further modification.

When an experiment is first created, by default it is under the folder of &#34;Work Queue&#34; and with a status of Draft. An experiment in &#34;Draft&#34; state can be edited by its owner but cannot be shared with other users

Experiment: lin-00011 is still a private experiment under the &#34;Work Queue&#34; folder. But it is now with a Status of In Progress. When an experiment is &#34;In Progress&#34;, owner can edit the experiment and share this experiment with the other users.

To make the experiment visible to public, the owner must submit the experiment to public. To do so, open the experiment: lin-00011 and then click on &#34;Make Experiment Public&#34;.
