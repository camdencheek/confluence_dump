  Details about the Question
</h2>
I&#39;ve managed to enter the wrong password too many times for our superuser account and was locked out of the UPT application. Since we only logged into UPT with this one user account, how can I go about changing the password/resetting the block?

If you are locked out of UPT account, the fastest way to unlock is to restart the UPT JBoss server.  Restarting the JBOSS server will help to remove the lock.
