  Introduction
</h2>
By default, a newly created experiment is not visible to the public. In this entry, we will demonstrate how to make experiment lin-00014 publicly visible and selectable. We will also show how to selectively display the data within the experiment.

When an experiment is newly created, it is not visible to the public by default, meaning a public user cannot see or find it.Public search result for a newly created experiment lin-00014

Starting in caArray 2.3, the public accessibility of an experiment is managed via the Permissions option by the experiment&#39;s owner. To change public visibility of experiment lin-00014, log into caArray and click on the Permissions icon of experiment lin-00014, shown by the arrow in the illustration below. This will lead to Experiment Permissions page.Permissions icon of experiment
