Users can regain control of an experiment that has been made public. However, in order to do so, users must first retract the experiment to the work queue.The illustrations below show the the workflow for making an experiment public and then retracting the experiment for further modification.

When an experiment is first created, by default it is under the &#34;Work Queue&#34; tab on the &#34;My Experiment Workspace&#34; page with a status of &#34;Draft&#34;. An experiment in the &#34;Draft&#34; state can be edited by its owner but cannot be shared with other users.In the screenshot above, two experiments are listed in the &#34;Work Queue&#34; table. They both show &#34;Draft&#34; under the &#34;Status&#34; column. The one we wish to make public is the one entitled &#34;fl_test02&#34;, which is represented by the experiment ID &#34;lin-00011&#34;.

To share the experiment &#34;lin-00011&#34;, open the experiment by clicking on its link in the table. This brings us to the &#39;Experiment Details&#39; page for this experiment. Now click on the &#34;Submit Experiment Proposal&#34; button in the upper right-hand corner to share the experiment.

Back on the &#39;My Experiment Workspace&#39; page, experiment &#34;lin-00011&#34; is still a private experiment under the &#34;Work Queue&#34; tab, but it now shows a status of &#34;In Progress&#34;. When an experiment is &#34;In Progress&#34;, the owner can edit the experiment and share this experiment with the other users.

To make the experiment visible to public, open the experiment once again by clicking on its link in the table to return back to the &#39;Experiment Details&#39; page. Now click on the &#34;Make Experiment Public&#34; button in the upper right-hand corner.

Experiment &#34;lin-00011&#34; is now a public experiment. It has been relocated to the &#34;Public Experiments&#34; tab. When an experiment is a public experiment, it can not be modified by anyone.

To modify a public experiment, the user must first revert that public experiment to the private status. To do so, open experiment &#34;lin-00011&#34; and then select the &#34;Retract Experiment From Public Accessibility&#34; button in the upper right-hand corner of the &#34;Experiment Details&#34; page.

The experiment lin-00011 is now again a private experiment and relocated back to the &#34;Work Queue&#34; tab, with a status of &#34;In progress&#34;. It is now available to be edited or shared.
