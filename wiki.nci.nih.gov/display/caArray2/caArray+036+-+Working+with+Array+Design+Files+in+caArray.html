  Introduction

One of the most frequently asked questions from the new caArray users is: &#34;Where can I obtain the array design file for my experiment?&#34;. Although the array providers&#39; websites are still the best places to obtain the most updated array design files (for more details, see

Any registered caArray user can upload, validate, and import the array designs from a supported array provider. If a desired array design file is not found in the caArray, the user can initiate the file upload into caArray:
<ul>
  <li>
    Click Import a New Array Design (Arrow 4 in the preceding illustration).
  </li>
  <li>
    This opens the New Array Design dialog box.
  </li>
  <li>
    Enter the appropriate information in the fields provided on Array Design Details form.

  Delete an Array Design
</h3>
After data has been imported into an experiment, the array design associated with that data cannot be removed from the experiment&#39;s list of array designs. Conversely, once an array design has been imported, the file associated with it cannot be changed. Array designs that are not associated with an experiment can now be deleted. To delete an array design, follow this step:
<ul>
  <li>
    On the row corresponding to the array design, click the Delete icon (arrow in the image below).
  </li>
  <li>
    A confirmation window will pop up. Once you click the &#34;OK&#34; button, the file will be physically deleted from caArray.
  </li>
</ul>

In caArray 2.2, any logged in user can edit an array design. To edit an array design, follow these steps:
<ul>
  <li>
    On the row corresponding to the array design, click the Edit icon.

  Replace an Array Design
</h3>
Once an array design has been imported and parsed into caArray, the array design file associated with it cannot be changed. You will have to delete the existing one and upload a new one. This can be done only if there is no experiment data associated with this array design file.The only array design file that can be replaced is the one imported without validation and parsing. (For more information on the definition of different file types, refer to caArray 016 - Which file can be parsed into caArray? What is the benefit of file parsing? Files Recognized by caArray.)To replace an array design file, follow these steps:
<ul>
  <li>
    Find the file that is replaceable (the file with a status of &#34;Imported (Not Parsed)&#34; (circled in red in the illustration).
  </li>
  <li>
    Click on &#34;Edit File&#34; icon (Arrow) to activate &#34;Upload Array Design File&#34; Window.
  </li>
  <li>
    Browse and find the new array design file.
  </li>
  <li>
    Save the new file by clicking the Save button.
  </li>
</ul>
