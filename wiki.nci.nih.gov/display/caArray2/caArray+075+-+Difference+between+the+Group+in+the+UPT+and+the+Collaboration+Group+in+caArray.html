  Details about the Question
</h2>
I created a new collaboration group, &#34;Research Fellow&#34;, in the UPT, and added a new user to this new group using the UPT. When the new user tried to log in to caArray, the error message appeared: &#34;Your current role does not allow you to view this page....&#34; I have associated the new group with all the available privileges in the UPT. Why can&#39;t this user log in?

The &#34;groups&#34; in the User Provisioning Tool (UPT) are different from &#34;collaboration groups&#34; in caArray. The UPT &#34;groups&#34; refer to predefined groups such as Principal Investigator or Lab Scientist, which determine what roles the user has. (See

.) The caArray &#34;collaboration groups&#34; are a way to group multiple users (for example, into an &#34;UPenn collaboration group&#34;) and control their access to experiments. The UPT &#34;groups&#34; are managed within UPT, whereas caArray &#34;collaboration groups&#34; are created and managed within the caArray application.caArray System Administrators must not use the &#34;Create a New Group&#34; function in UPT. To assign a user with a role, choose from the predefined roles under the Existing Group linkUPT Groups

The UPT is a separately installed application which serves as the user management interface for all National Cancer Institute CBIIT Life Sciences Distribution (LSD) applications. caArray is just one of the applications that use the UPT to manage user access. Therefore, not all the functionalities in the UPT are applicable in caArray. A user with System Admin privileges in the UPT can, but should not, create new caArray groups in the UPT because the caArray was not designed to use this functionality of the UPT. caArray only uses UPT to create new users and assign new users to the existing groups. The only predefined groups for caArray users are System Administrator, Principal Investigator, Lab Administrator, Lab Scientist and Biostatistician. It is worth noting that all predefined groups except the System Admin have the same access privileges in caArray. It is also worth noting that any other group created in UPT cannot be recognized by caArray.Predefined Groups for caArray Users Also Showing Collaboration Groups (Highlighted Last Entry in Group Description Column)

Collaboration groups can only be created in caArray, and any registered user can create and manage collaboration groups to control data sharing of the user&#39;s own experiments. Click MANAGE COLLABORATION GROUPS in caArray menu to create or manage collaboration groups.When a collaboration group is created, it will show up in the UPT &#34;group&#34; list. That is why if you created a &#34;group&#34; in the UPT, you will not be able to use the same name to create a collaboration group in caArray. You have to delete the &#34;group&#34; created in UPT before you can create the collaboration group in caArray using the same name.
