caArray offers two options to annotate the experiment.
<ul>
  <li>
    You can annotate the experiment automatically (recommended) by uploading/Importing MAGE-TAB formatted annotation files (

      caArray 007 - MAGE-TAB Files
    </a>
    ).
  </li>
  <li>
    You can annotate the experiment manually by entering data using the

      Annotations tab

The Annotations tab opens with seven subtabs for entering annotation data for the experiment you are creating: Experimental Design, Experiment Factors, Source, Extracts, Labeled Extract and Hybridizations, as shown in the illustration. Detailed definitions and explanations for each subtab can be found in the

      </td>
      <td>
        Click on the Annotations Tab in caArray. Enter annotations field by field.
      </td>
      <td>
        Upload pre-created tab-delimited MAGE-TAB files (IDF and SDRF format). Annotation data needs to be validated and imported together with the array data files referenced in SDRF file(s).

      </td>
      <td>
        Flexible with some limitations. Biomaterial related characteristics/attributes can be modified or added via annotation user interface.
        Experimental factor, protocol, design, or publication related attributes cannot be changed. They become read-only after files are imported.
        Additional annotation data added through annotation interface cannot be downloaded (see below).

    <tr>
      <td>
        Auto Generated Annotation
      </td>
      <td>
        During data import, caArray offers options of associating array data with the existing annotations or auto-creating new annotations for a Source - Sample - Extract - Labeled Extract - Hybridization chain based on the data imported. You can enter the rest of the annotations on the annotation interface after the chain has been created.
      </td>
      <td>
        The Annotation information in IDF and SDRF files is automatically assigned to each annotation field during data import. If a biomaterial node is missing in the Source - Sample - Extract - Labeled Extract - Hybridization chain, appropriate intermediate nodes are automatically generated to complete the chain.

  Summary
</h3>
In summary, the annotation user interface (Annotation tab) offers a straight forward and quick way to enter annotation data. MAGE-TAB annotation files allow the user to create complex annotations and keep annotation editing and maintenance manageable at the same time. MAGE-TAB files allow users to enter the annotations that are not displayed as generically available and editable fields in the annotation user interface. These customized annotation data entered via MAGE-TAB files are visible but un-editable on caArray. Furthermore, MAGE-TAB files are portable and reusable, thus saving time and effort, especially when a large set of samples are collected from the same source.
