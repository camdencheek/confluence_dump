  Details about the Question
</h2>
Our current caArray instance is on caGrid&#39;s production indexing service. Since this instance becomes our staging server, can we point it to caGrid&#39;s training indexing server?

Yes, you can point your caArray instance to a different grid indexing service.

Currently, there are two public caGrid indexing servers: production and training caGrid services. Each caArray instance can only be deployed on one of the caGrid services. The URL for the caArray grid service is defined in the file below:



$JBOSS_HOME/server/default/deploy/wsrf.war/WEB-INF/etc/cagrid_CaArraySvc/CaArraySvc_registration.xml
<h3 id="caArray028PointingthecaArraygridservicetoadifferentgridindexingservice-Case1.caArrayserverisalreadyononeofthegridservices">
  Case 1. caArray server is already on one of the grid services
</h3>
If your caArray service is already on the production grid service, you need to alter the Index service URL (&lt;ServiceGroupEPR&gt;&lt;wsa:Address&gt;) from the production grid URL:



http://cagrid-index.nci.nih.gov:8080/wsrf/services/DefaultIndexService



to the caGrid&#39;s training grid URL:



http://index.training.cagrid.org:8080/wsrf/services/DefaultIndexService



Once the URL is changed, restart the JBOSS server to reset the service.
