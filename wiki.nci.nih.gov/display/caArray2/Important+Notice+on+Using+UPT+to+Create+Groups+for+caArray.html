As you might know, caArray uses UPT to create and manage users. Although UPT has the ability to create user groups and protection groups, caArray does not use those features and has its own way to create collaboration groups. As a result, users should be aware of the following:
<ul>
  <li>
    Do NOT use protection elements or protection groups directly within UPT
  </li>
  <li>
    Do NOT create caArray collaboration groups within UPT
  </li>
</ul>
Doing so may result in irreversible changes to the data in caArray database, and will require reinstallation of caArray.

Sorry for the inconvinience this might cause you. We are looking into ways to resolve this issue in the near future.
