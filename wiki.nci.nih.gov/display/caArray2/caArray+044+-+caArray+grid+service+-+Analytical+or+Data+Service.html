I went to

</a>
to search for my caArray grid service. I see that it appears as an Analytical Service, not as a Data Service. I am assuming caArray is a data service. Is there a setting I have to set?

Starting with caArray 2.3.0.1, the caArray grid node is automatically classified as an Analytical Service. All the grid nodes from the previous caArray versions were classified as a Data Service. The user does not need to set any parameter.
