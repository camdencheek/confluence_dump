I notice that on the
<a href="https://wiki.nci.nih.gov/x/sgO8AQ" rel="nofollow">
  &#34;caArray 2.4.0 install.properties&#34; wiki page
</a>
, there are following properties:



grid.ssl.enable
grid.ssl.keystore.location
grid.ssl.keystore.pass
grid.ssl.keystore.alias
grid.ssl.fullyqualified.hostname
grid.secure.enable
grid.secure.port
grid.secure.cert.location
grid.secure.key.location



Do these mean that there&#39;s secure Grid services for caArray?

No. These parameters were included due to requirements from BDA templates. However, caArray does not use the parameters because it does not yet have secure grid service implementation. It is important to note that these parameters should not be removed or modified because the installer checks the existence of the parameters. It is also worth noting that removing and editing of these parameters was not tested.
