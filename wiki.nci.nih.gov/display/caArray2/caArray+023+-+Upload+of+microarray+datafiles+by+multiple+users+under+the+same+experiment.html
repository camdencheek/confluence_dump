  Details about the Question
</h2>
I have created a new experiment for the investigator. Now I need to transfer the ownership under me to my investigator. Can I do that?

Yes. Multiple users can contribute the data under the same pre-published experiment. To enable this function, the experiment owner must first make the experiment sharable and assign the access right to a collaborator group:
<ol>
  <li>
    The owner needs to change the experiment from &#34;Draft&#34; state to &#34;In Progress&#34; state by clicking &#34;Submit Experiment Proposal&#34;.
  </li>
  <li>
    The owner grants the &#34;Read/Write&#34; or other appropriate role to a selected collaborator group. Refer to caArrayDemo-002 How to Use caArray to Share Pre-Publishing Data? listed under caArray Usage on the
    <a href="https://wiki.nci.nih.gov/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=42832153" rel="nofollow">

    page.
  </li>
  <li>
    Other users in this collaborator group can now upload new files to this experiment.
  </li>
  <li>
    Different users can only access others&#39; files after the files have been imported (that is, under the &#34;Imported Data&#34; tab and &#34;supplemental file&#34;). If a file is still in the working stage (that is, under the &#34;Manage Data&#34; tab), it is only accessible to its own submitter.
  </li>
</ol>
For detailed steps on how to share pre-published data, please refer to How to Use caArray to Share Pre-Publishing Data?

Special Note for caArray Version 2.3 and upStarting in caArray version 2.3, Step 1 is no longer necessary. All public visibility is also managed under Permissions.
