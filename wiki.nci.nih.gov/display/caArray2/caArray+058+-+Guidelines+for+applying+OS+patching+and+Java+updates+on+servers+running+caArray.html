Every released caArray application has been tested on a supported tech stack. There is a possibility that caArray might work on a platform besides the supported one, but the caArray team cannot support the updates to the OS or Java outside of what has been tested.

The supported tech stack for the latest version of caArray as of this writing, v2.4.0.1, can be found in the latest

  <li>
    Linux AS 4 64/32-bit  (for AMD chipset)
