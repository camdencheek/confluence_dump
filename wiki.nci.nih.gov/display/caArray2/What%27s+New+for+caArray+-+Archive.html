<ul>
  <li>
    This release introduces the new caArray service API v1.0 that has several advantages over the legacy API:
  </li>
  <li>
    It sets the framework for backwards compatibility. You will have greater flexibility in planning your application releases instead of being tied to the caArray release schedule.
  </li>
  <li>
    It provides a richer set of API methods that let you retrieve data in a more intuitive way. You no longer have to write complicated queries or a series of queries in order to perform common data retrieval tasks.
  </li>
  <li>
    It provides better performance for several common use cases.
  </li>
  <li>
    A production version of caArray 2.3.0 is available on the NCI CBIIT production server: array.nci.nih.gov.

<ul>
  <li>
    The key features for this minor release of caArray are the ability to change experiment and collaborator group ownership and a requirement to submit GenePix data using MAGE-TAB files in order to disambiguate the sample - data file relationships.

    Approximately 80 features/issues were addressed in this release (see the

    </a>
    (login required)). Highlights of this release are:
    <ul>
      <li>
        Sample search:
        <ul>
          <li>
            The user can now search for biomaterials (Samples and Sources) in the system.
          </li>
          <li>
            The keyword search can be applied to one of a list of standard or predefined categories, or to arbitrary categories previously imported into the system via Characteristic[] columns in a MAGE-TAB SDRF document.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        Export experiment annotations in MAGE-TAB format:
        <ul>
          <li>
            The user can generate and download a MAGE-TAB file set describing the annotations of an experiment.
          </li>
          <li>
            The generated MAGE-TAB includes the relationship between biomaterials, hybridizations and data files, and also characteristics of the biomaterials.
          </li>
          <li>
            The generated MAGE-TAB does not contain information about experimental factors, protocols, publications or people.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        Bulk-update of experiment annotations using MAGE-TAB import:
        <ul>
          <li>
            When a MAGE-TAB file set is being imported, the System recognizes references to existing biomaterials and hybridizations by name.
          </li>
          <li>
            Biomaterial linkages can be modified in an additive way via MAGE-TAB import. Existing linkages and biomaterials cannot be deleted via MAGE-TAB import.
          </li>
          <li>
            Biomaterial characteristics can be modified or new characteristics added via MAGE-TAB import.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        Support for GEO and ScanArray data:
        <ul>
          <li>
            Data files can be designated as GEO SOFT or GEO GSM and then imported (without parsing) and associated with samples.
          </li>
          <li>
            ScanArray CSV data files can be imported (without parsing) and associated with samples.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        Enhanced usability of permissions management workflow:
        <ul>
          <li>
            While setting sample-selective access for an experiment, the user can do a keyword search for Samples against a set of categories, select the Samples of interest, and grant access to the selected Samples as a whole.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
