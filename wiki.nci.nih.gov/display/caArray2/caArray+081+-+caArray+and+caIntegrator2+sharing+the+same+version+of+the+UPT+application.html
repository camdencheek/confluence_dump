  Details about the Question
</h2>
We had previously installed caArray - v2.2.1, and UPT - v3.2.0. Recently, we added caIntegrator2 - v1.0 on Redhat 5. They are all on one machine using the same mysql instance. However, we couldn&#39;t provision additional caIntegrator2 users.

  Answer
</h2>
Both caArray, caIntegrator2 are using UPT and CSM as their provision tools. Since the applications were developed independently, they might be requiring a different versions of UPT and CSM. In order to share the same UPT application, it is important to have the UPT installation to be the highest version required by the applications. UPT is backward compatible to the previous version used by the other applications.

The table below compares the available versions of each application, and their corresponding UPT version used. If the caArray and caIntegrator applications are installed on the same server, the highest version of UPT and CSM should be installed.UPT Compatibility
