There are two steps involved in user account creation in caArray:
<ol>
  <li>
    A potential user starts the online request by clicking the &#34;Register&#34; link, completes the steps as shown on the registration form, and submits the form by clicking &#34;Submit Registration Request&#34;.
  </li>
  <li>
    The caArray system administrator receives the request form and creates the user account in the CBIIT User Provisioning Tool (UPT) based on the information provided by the user.
  </li>
</ol>

The user must select one of the five available roles listed on the form: System Administrator, Principal Investigator, Lab Administrator, Lab Scientist, Biostatistician.

The table compares the five roles. In caArray version 2.x and all prior versions, all five roles can own experiments. The only group that has additional privileges is the &#34;System Administrator&#34; group. The &#34;System Administrator&#34; group has the ability to change the ownership for both experiments and groups. (For more detailed information on how to change ownership, see

According to the table above, the different access roles in caArray have different responsibilities and permissible actions. For the four roles of Principal Investigator, Lab Administrator, Lab Scientist, and Biostatistician, the user is responsible for owning experiments and/or projects, and the permissible actions include submitting data, writing experiment decisions, and submitting annotation and array data. For the System Administrator role, the user is responsible for the effective operation of caArray, and the permissible actions include all the ones of the other four roles, plus the ability to manage users.

Note about future releasesIn subsequent versions of caArray, role-specific features will be implemented that will limit certain actions to specific users.
