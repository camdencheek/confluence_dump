  Details about the Question
</h2>
I am using caArray, version 2.3.1. I attempted to upload a .zip file with the &#34;Unpack Compressed Archive&#34; option, I get the following error message:

Zip file (name) you uploaded was not fully unpacked. The reason was: errors.unpackingZip.
Some of the files from this ZIP file may have been added. Subsequent files in your upload were not processed.

Only a flat list of file can be used for uploading with the &#34;Unpack Compressed Archive&#34; option. The error in question might be caused by the directory structure inside the .zip files. In order to get the .zip file to upload successfully, there should be no folder structure inside the zip file submitted.
