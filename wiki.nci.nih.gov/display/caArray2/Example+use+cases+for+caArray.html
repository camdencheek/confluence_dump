  Use Case 1 - caArray as an intermediary between the investigator, a core facility and a biostatistician
</h2>
Data is often transmitted between a core facility, the lab and the statistician using DVDs or other physical methods.  Instead, a local copy of caArray can serve as a data collection and dissemination point.
<ul>
  <li>
    The Principal Investigator defines a new experiment in the caArray web interface.
  </li>
  <li>
    Laboratory personnel, microarray core facility personnel and scientific collaborators are added to the project.
  </li>
  <li>
    The local microarray core facility process Affymetrix microarrays and uploads CEL and CHP files to the experiment.
  </li>
  <li>
    A technician enters sample information and associates each sample with its CEL and CHP files.
  </li>
  <li>
    A statistician downloads the CEL files and performs a primary analysis in R, beginning with RMA analysis.
  </li>
  <li>
    The RMA analyzed primary data matrix is uploaded to the experiment in a tabular (CSV or tab-delimited) format as a single file.
  </li>
  <li>
    Data can be further explored by PI or students by downloading the data to geWorkbench.
    <ul>
      <li>
        Either the RMA derived data matrix file could be downloaded from caArray and then loaded into geWorkbench, or
      </li>
      <li>
        the original CHP data could be transferred via the caArray API to geWorkbench for further normalization, filtering and analysis.
      </li>

  Use Case 2 - A lab performs a bulk upload of experimental data using the MAGE-TAB method
</h2>
For labs not wanting to enter data through the web interface to caArray, the spreadsheet format used by the MAGE-TAB method allows easy description of the experiment and data.
<ul>
  <li>
    The Principal Investigator defines a new experiment in the caArray web interface.
  </li>
  <li>
    Laboratory personnel and scientific collaborators are added to the project.
  </li>
  <li>
    The local microarray core facility process Affymetrix microarrays and transmits data to Investigator (file sharing, DVD etc).
  </li>
  <li>
    Technician prepares MAGE-TAB spreadsheets in Excel (IDF and SDRF files) with all required experiment descriptions and linkages between samples and resulting array files.
  </li>
  <li>
    A complete MAGE-TAB package is created as one or more ZIP file containing the raw data files (CEL and CHP) and the IDF and SDRF files.
  </li>
  <li>
    The MAGE-TAB package is uploaded into caArray.
  </li>
  <li>
    The uploaded data is imported into caArray.
  </li>
  <li>
    Statistician can now download array data files for further analysis if not already done.
  </li>
  <li>
    Analysis results (e.g. RMA normalized data matrix) is uploaded to the experiment as an ancillary file.
  </li>
  <li>
    As above, further analysis is possible in tools such as geWorkbench.
  </li>
