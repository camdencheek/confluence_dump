Check your caArray version - You will not be able to delete an experiment with the status as &#34;In Progress&#34; if your caArray version is older than 2.3.0. Starting from version 2.3.0, we changed experiment management process to allow deletion of the experiments in the &#34;In Progress&#34; state.

To get rid of the &#34;In Progress&#34; experiments in an older version, you need to upgrade your application to version 2.3.0 or newer. As of today, the current version is
