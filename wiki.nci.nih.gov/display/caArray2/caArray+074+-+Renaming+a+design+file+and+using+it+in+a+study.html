  Details about the Question
</h2>
When importing a new design file, I got a message: &#34;An array design already exists with the name... and provider ....&#34;.  Can I rename the file to upload and use it in my study?

No. The reason is that the name of the design file is referenced in the experiment data file; change of the name of the design file will result in validation error while you import your experiment data.

If a copy of the design file with exact same name and provider already exists in the caArray, you do not have to load a new copy; you can use the file for your study. If you want to reload a copy of a design file with the same name, you should delete that file first.
