Can I change the admin (caArray registration) e-mail address after installation? I had tried to configure it in the JBOSS of caArray, however it did not seem to work.

Yes, you can update the admin email address after caArray installation. The &#34;To:&#34; and &#34;From:&#34; email addresses can be updated in the MySQL DB. Here is the example SQL that will set both values:



update config_parameter set raw_value = &#39;sysadmin@mydomain.com&#39; where param = &#39;REG_EMAIL_TO&#39;;
update config_parameter set raw_value = &#39;noreply@mydomain.com&#39; where param = &#39;EMAIL_FROM&#39;;
