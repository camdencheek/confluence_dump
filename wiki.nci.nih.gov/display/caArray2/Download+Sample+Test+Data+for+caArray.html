The test data works with caArray 2.0.x and 2.1. The document &#34;Instructions for caArray data load&#34; provides step-by-step instructions for loading data into caArray 2.0.2, and testing the caArray Service. The instructions will allow each center to validate that its grid node is functional.To test your caArray application with real sample data, please download the following instructions and sample files.
