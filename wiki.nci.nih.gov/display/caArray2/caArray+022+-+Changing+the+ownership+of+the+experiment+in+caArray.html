Yes. Changing ownership is a new feature implemented in caArray Version 2.2.1 (Released May, 2009). The ownership transfer can only be performed by a caArray user with system administrator privileges.

Upon login as system administrator, a link called &#34;Manage Ownership&#34; will appear under &#34;User management&#34; in the left menu. To Change the ownership, please follow steps below:
<ol>
  <li>
    System administrator (SA) clicks &#34;Manage Ownership&#34; .
  </li>
  <li>
    After providing First Name or Last Name, SA clicks &#34;Filter&#34;. A list of users who meet the filtering criteria is returned.
  </li>
  <li>
    SA selects the Username of the user who currently owns the experiment, and clicks &#34;Find Assets&#34; to find the experiments associated with this user.
