Primary activity has been around coordinating with NCBI to bring in canine data related to studies currently in process. This will minimize duplication and ensure availability of the data going forward. NCBI was receptive to our suggestion to model the data sharing after CDS and we will be housing the AWS data in ICDC buckets.DGAB has received an evaluated a new study for a total of 7. We are currently processing 3 and are still working on the first two. With the data transfer from NCBI, we expect to have three full studies, and possibly 4 available by July/August.
