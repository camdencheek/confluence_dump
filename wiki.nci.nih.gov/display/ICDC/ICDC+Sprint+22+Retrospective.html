    The team came together and we worked towards a workflow to deploy microservices that works for all projects based on the experience we had (Amit Mukherjee).
  </li>
  <li>
    Although, there is room for improvement the team worked hard to get the release out the door and I&#39;m very proud of the work that was accomplished (

    for helping the ICDC team navigate the ICDC Release process. Mike did a great job coordinating with the CloudOne team and keeping the Release Dashboard updated (

    The release was a &#34;risky release &#34;  :  QA when signed off to prod , we did not have high confidence on the quality of the product , as we were scrambling till the last minute to finish the testing on stage .(Laxmi Lolla)
  </li>
  <li>
    The Build was incorrect on stage which we were testing for all the DME changes and FS version was not matching that of QA .( Laxmi Lolla)
  </li>
  <li>
    The DME was pointing to the dev Schema and we found out  on the day of stage release this triggered a manual regression to be finished in 4 hours for a go no . We were lucky that nothing broke in production.( Laxmi Lolla)
  </li>
  <li>
    After the &#34;code freeze&#34; we get &#34;hot fixes&#34;  , if we are getting daily one sometimes two builds as &#34; hot fixes &#34; this defeats the purpose of code freeze. QA needs a stable  build without any changes at least 3 days to have this confidence that everything is tested and no bugs will creep to production . Can we limit &#34;hot-fix Builds  to a maximum of two after code freeze?( Laxmi Lolla ).

    Under Estimation of the code Complexity to implement Facet Value ui Display &#34;label&#34;. Number of Search Faceted Sections and Facets item of Data Explorer Navigator should be capped. (

    We needed an elegant way of microservice version management and hand-off across different tiers.(Amit Mukherjee)
