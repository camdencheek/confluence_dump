Charter: This Subcommittee will have responsibility for identifying and recommending best practices that the ICDC will implement to streamline and harmonize data collection, standardize data formats and platforms, and manage and annotate data (especially clinical data). The ICDC prototype will encompass clinical, pathologic, genomic, biomarker and imaging data. The overall goal of the Best Practices SubCommittee (BPSC) will be to streamline and standardize data collection and management for canine studies.  The BPSC will examine past and planned studies and will recommend prospective standards for data collection and management including clinical, pathologic, and sequencing data. The BPSC is composed of the following members of the Integrated Canine Data Commons Steering Committee:

The following working groups were identified:Imaging WG: Paula Jacobs, Amy LeBlanc (bridge to clin/path WG)Goals: The overarching objective of this WG is to provide the comparative cancer research community with guidelines and best practices for the collection, formatting and reporting of imaging data collected from canine companion animals with naturally-occurring cancers into the Integrated Canine Data Commons (ICDC). This is to facilitate the utilization and analysis of such data by stakeholders in the cancer research community to facilitate dog-to-human translational research and advancement of knowledge in the comparative space.Clinical/pathologic standards WG: Renee Chambers (primary co-chair), Amy LeBlanc (bridge to imag. WG), Cheryl London (secondary co-chair), Deborah KnappGenomics WG: Dawn Duval Elaine Ostrander, Shaying Zhou, Heather GardnerThe goals of the ICDC Genomics Best Practices Subcommittee Guidelines are to:·        Provide an overview of next generation sequencing (NGS) study design, assays and analysis approaches (focusing on genomics and transcriptomics) utilized by diverse canine cancer research teams alongside annotation of validation studies, canine-specific tool needs, and parameters.·        Identify common elements across published analyses.·        Establish general principles in canine cancer genomics best practices modeled on human cancer genomics best practice principles.·        Identify gaps in canine cancer genomics best practices and propose solutions.Immunology: Toby Hecht, Cheryl London (primary co-chair), Deborah Knapp (secondary co-chair), Connie Sommers, Shaying ZhaoThe BPSC will be supported by FNL staff as needed.  FNL contact is: Gina Kuffel (gina.kuffle@nih.gov) and Todd Pihl (todd.pihl@nih.gov)
