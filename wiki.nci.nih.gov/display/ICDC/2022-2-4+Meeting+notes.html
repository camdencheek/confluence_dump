Toby - Regarding the Focus Group Discussions so far, parallel data between canine and humans from the same treatment, cell sub-types before and after treatment, environmental insults in canines vs. humans (exposures for humans cause cancer, canines subjected to same exposures), urothelial cancers in human vs. canine (Knapp lab has studied this), looking for data beyond genomics data.Debbie - Lots of groups showing interest, proteomic data coming, others will mine the data we are generating.Toby - Adverse events in canines in clinical trials, important for comparison to human. Warren brought up flea and tick medications and this can be absorbed by their human companions and be linked to cancer. Connie suggested looking at raw flow cytometry data, this data can be used to make predictions. The NanoString data will be coming and will introduce data model expansions. Potential to involve pharma.Connie - Possibly the aging study, involves all breeds.Toby - Waiting to hear from Dan Promislow and to determine if he has had communications with the Aging Institute will co-fund with the NCI looking at canine tumors and conducting sequencing. Need to secure this before the end of the fiscal year in order to use the funding.Toby - Genomics Working group and the Imaging Working group is part of the BPSC, Data Governance Advisory Board is separate led by Warren Kibbe.

1. Genomic correlates across platforms (DNA, RNA, protein).2. Correlating multi-omics data with clinical annotation and phenotypes, particularly outcomes.3. Comparative analyses of canine and human. Examples include:1. Search for conserved mutations between canine and human tumors2. Disease diagnosis (e.g. cancer type) and classification mapping between canines and humans5. Gene expression changes and mutational profiles associated with therapeutic response and outcome6. How do sporadic tumors in non-human mammals compare to sporadic human tumors?7. Correlations and model building from radiomic and pathomic features extracted from medical and histopathologic images with outcomes and genomics, as is currently being widely done with human images8. Develop biomarkers of response and resistance in humans by analyzing the responses and genomic signatures in dogs.

TH- If you find differences, this can be compared with human data to compare the prevalence.EK- Potential extra credit questionTH- Should include some human aspect.EK- Scope of this exercise is limited to ICDC portalTH- Emphasize the downstream possibilities.DK- There is a group at Purdue utilizing brain cancer data in ICDC to ask new questions, one thing they have done is to acquire true normals, what is in ICDC now are adjacent normals. These new controls provide new insights. They are looking at astros vs. oligos. It might help to have the normals available.TH- Range of expertise is needed to form a committee for the future phase of ICDC. We have to know how can we make sense of the data and develop new hypothesis. Very few people have volunteered.CS- Dan Regan, Nikki, and Cheryl volunteered.AL- Happy to volunteer as well.TH- Will organize something early February for a formal brainstorming session. This will be used to inform the case proposed to Ned Sharpless. I would like to get Warren Kibbe on this panel. As head of the DGAB it would be appropriate.DK- Happy to volunteer as well. TH- Thinking through some ideas myself. Outside the box ideas are welcome as well.RP- From precision medicine, what is the dog model for the human disease I am studying, what are the considerations for differences in dosing ideasTH- Come up with a statement for a precision medicine use caseAL- Harmonizing theme is we need data that helps to inform the molecular landscape of various cancers with an emphasis on targeted drug development. On Osteo we have discovered a gene signature that clusters and this holds true in humans as well. Opens up ideas of drug therapies.RP- Body of knowledge available if there is translational research is being conducted.TH- Longitudinal studies would be preferential.RP- Clinical agents that have performed well in canine that have never been tried in human.TH- Is it useful for PD group to hear about ICDC?RP- I think so, we are in the process of coming up with some use cases for possible data submission, I think people don&#39;t ask questions because it is not part of the their daily work life at this moment. Use case: where is LINE3 expressed in the dogAL- Many people have FFPE samples of canine cancers available, trouble is validated tissue expression, don&#39;t have good IHC antibodies.TH- Immunology field in canines is way behind that of human.
