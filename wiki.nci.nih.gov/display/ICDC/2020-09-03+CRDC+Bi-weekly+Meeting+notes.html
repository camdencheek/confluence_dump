        SC Meeting 9/2/20
      </td>
      <td colspan="1"></td>
      <td colspan="1">
        We met with SC yesterday and we are soliciting their feedback on the system as part of user acceptance testing, including building a test case with the existing data.  We also asked for their assistance in further data acquisition, outreach, and increasing system visibility. Suggestions were made to present at AACR and ASCO and we will be looking into these opportunities.  We are presenting posters at the Paws-For-A-Cure and Veterinary Cancer Society meetings (Sept/Oct., respectively).  Comms team asked for and received our abstract for the upcoming Paw-4-a-cure symposium and is looking into ways to promote it. Steering Committee speakers at this symposium have been asked to mention the IDCD and Connie Sommers indicated this would be a primary focus of her talk.
