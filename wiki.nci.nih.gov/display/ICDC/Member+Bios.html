): Dr. Breen is a Professor of Genomics and the Oscar J. Fletcher Distinguished Professor of Comparative Oncology Genetics at NC State College of Veterinary Medicine.  The main focus of Dr. Breen’s lab over the past 25 years has been the comparative genomics of animal and human cancers, with an emphasis on the domestic dog.  He was a member of the team that sequencing the canine genome in 2004 and has since developed a series of reagents and tools for comparative cytogenetics.  His lab has published widely on the role of the dog as spontaneous animal model for cancer. Dr. Breen serves on numerous advisory panels for funding agencies in the US, Canada and Europe.CONFIRMED Renee Chambers, DVM, MD (

): a professor of neurosurgery at The University of Alabama at Birmingham, has partnered with veterinarians to conduct the first immunotherapy study for brain tumors in dogs using an oncolytic herpes simplex virus known as M032. The virus, developed at UAB, is also being used in a clinical trial to treat humans with the same tumors, allowing for adirect “head-to-head” comparison of safety and effectiveness, a first in comparative oncology. Systematic collection and development of a genomics database will provide innumerable opportunities to explore a rational approach to safer and more effective therapies for people and pets.  This

opens up an exciting new research pathway while providing the potential of a therapy that could benefit both humans and canines with brain tumors. CONFIRMED Dawn Duval (

):  Dr. Hendricks&#39; laboratory seeks to map the genetic underpinnings of cancers that occur naturally in pet dogs and to compare these genomic landscapes to those of human cancers. These studies inform our understanding of cancer evolution. They also fuel translational development of genomically guided treatments for pet dogs and humans alike.CONFIRMED Warren Kibbe (

She also serves as co-program leader for the Medicinal Chemistry Program in the Purdue University Center for Cancer Research. Her group’s work is strongly focused in urinary bladder cancer, and specifically in naturally-occurring high grade invasive urothelial carcinoma in dogs and humans. Their work includes disease characterization (molecular to clinical), early detection/intervention, treatment, and prognostication.Cheryl London (

): My lab studies glioma across age groups and species, leveraging a combination of high throughput sequencing and computational analysis. We have reported gene expression and molecular marker based classifications of glioma in adult patients. More recently, we discovered that extrachromosomal oncogene amplifications play a major role in driving intratumoral heterogeneity in cancer.CONFIRMED Shaying Zhao (

):  My lab is interested in understanding the population genetics of dog breeds and using that information to identify genes underlying disease susceptibility, particularly those associated with cancer. Our interests extend to understanding breed development and demonstrating how that data can facilitate studies of cancer development, metastasis and treatment responses. We generate large amounts of genomic and population structure data and, therefore, have a strong interest in developing tools and databases to share that information in the most accessible fashion.CONFIRMED Anju Singh (
