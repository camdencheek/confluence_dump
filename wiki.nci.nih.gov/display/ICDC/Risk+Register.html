Mitigation
<ul>
  <li>
    Accept- Recognize that the risk exists and needs to be monitored but take no steps to affect the probability of the risk or to plan for action should the risk materialize
  </li>
  <li>
    Reduce/Enhance - Put active measures in place to reduce the threat of a negative risk  occurring or enhance the chance of a positive risk occurring
  </li>
  <li>
    Transfer/Share- Take steps to move the risk from the project to a third party more capable of managing the risk
  </li>
  <li>
    Avoid/Exploit - Take steps to completely eliminate the possibility of a negative risk occurring (avoid) or guaranteeing that a positive risk will happen (exploit)
  </li>
</ul>
Probability
<ul>
  <li>
    High - Has happened at least 50% of the time or more
  </li>
  <li>
    Medium - Between low and high
  </li>
  <li>
    Low - Has happened only once before
  </li>
</ul>
Impact
<ul>
  <li>
    High - Requires change to agreed upon scope, budget, schedule and quality
  </li>
  <li>
    Medium - Risk can be accommodated but will require adjusting scope
  </li>
  <li>
    Low - Risk can be accommodated within existing agreed upon scope, budget, schedule and quality
  </li>
</ul>

        We were informed yesterday that the dockerized version of Gen3 to which we had been pointed by UChicago staff was incomplete and outdated and was not planned to be supported. Meetings were held with UChicago staff yesterday and it was resolved that they would point us to current code and help us stand up a non-dockerized version over the course of the next few weeks. This has resulted in a loss of time/money for all work done on the system since Nov. 1, 2018.

        There is a risk that Seven Bridges Genomics will not develop their interactions with the ICDC in time for our MVP release (Dec. 31, 2019). SGB has been delaying a decision about the manifest and whether that should be a complete copy of the study or simply a reference to the files of interest. Without knowing their desired strategy, we will not be able to provide interoperability between the two systems until it is decided.
