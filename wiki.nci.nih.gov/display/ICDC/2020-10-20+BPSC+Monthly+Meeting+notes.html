        Provided list of genes for Immuno panel to Matt/Philip - these will be most common across studies - assay is standard and gene list is fixed. Potential data sets in 3 months once panel starts producing data.

        Value spaces are in groundrules and guidelines.  Different range for normal for various chemistry tests - will use normal vs. abnormal instead of absolute values. Standards still evolving.

        Discussions about potential normal germline data sets to be included in pipeline to be used in analysis (from Elaine). Challenges: what kind of data do we want to include; many different pipelines/pathways used - hesitant to say what best is. Shaying has done most normalization and is providing her pipeline parameters as baseline suggestion.  Will have table of tools and parameters for a pipeline with suggestions for tweaks. Interactions with Seven Bridges Genomics to establish pipeline.  Data harmonization - goal is to combine germline data set effort with genomic data harmonization effort due to overlap. Internal deadlines set for editing and reviewing documents.

        Ned Sharpless asked about ICDC - told him about the demo from SBG.  He wants to be brought up to date on ICDC/SBG. He will be getting in touch with CBIIT for a demonstration. Todd heard from Tony Kerlavage and will arrange.
