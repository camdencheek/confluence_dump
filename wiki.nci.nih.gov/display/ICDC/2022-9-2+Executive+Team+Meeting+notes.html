TH- Possible COI with people working on the RFI and then responding to the RFI. Dr. Doroshow signed off on RFI. Unless there are issues noted the RFI should be published in ~ 2 weeks. Many ideas came from initial focus groups. JO- What type of plans can be put in place to advertise the RFI? Can we leverage NCI social media?TH- We can send to anyone we want, including Cancer Center Directors, they have collaborations with vet clinic schools, some of the foundations.AL- Circulate to PRECINCT as well.TH- Deadline for response is Dec. 1st.AL- Giving presentation to the children&#39;s oncology group. Touched base with CIN and PRECINCT. The talk is osteo-focused.

1. Genomic correlates across platforms (DNA, RNA, protein).2. Correlating multi-omics data with clinical annotation and phenotypes, particularly outcomes.3. Comparative analyses of canine and human. Examples include:1. Search for conserved mutations between canine and human tumors2. Disease diagnosis (e.g. cancer type) and classification mapping between canines and humans5. Gene expression changes and mutational profiles associated with therapeutic response and outcome6. How do sporadic tumors in non-human mammals compare to sporadic human tumors?7. Correlations and model building from radiomic and pathomic features extracted from medical and histopathologic images with outcomes and genomics, as is currently being widely done with human images8. Develop biomarkers of response and resistance in humans by analyzing the responses and genomic signatures in dogs.

Toby- Understanding of RFI is to go out ask for people doing comparative oncology across humans and dogs research to come up with questions or case studies or hypotheses that can leverage data in the ICDC to answer these question to expose gaps of data to inform the type of data we would like to source in the future.DK- To identify key questions and if ICDC can help to answer these questions.Toby- Who will be the PoC? I will do an outline of this and then circulate to this to the Executive Team.JO - Executive TEam and then polish for broader dissemination to the Steering Committee.Toby- We can send out to the Cancer CentersAL - We can encourage all to share broadly Action item
