  Minutes (Not Verbatim)
</h2>
Toby - We don&#39;t have sequencing data for comparing before and after therapy to detect genomic changesAmy - I think Debbie Knapp has this data showing a transcriptional shift in BRAF-mutant bladder cancerToby - There has been a suggestion to go beyond cancer and involve other institutes particularly if they can help with funding. Also the Dog Aging project looks at normal dogs until end of life and some of them develop tumors and the NCI is willing to co-fund sequencing on these tumors as they arise. We are waiting to hear back from Aging Institute, other thing is investigating environmental exposures in relation to tumors. Let&#39;s derive a list of interesting topics.Warren - Representing the life trajectory of the dogs, attaching the specimens and data derived from those specimens at the appropriate point in that dog&#39;s life would be valuable. The pre and post- treatment specimens are one example (genomics, proteomics, microbiome). Let&#39;s say we have measurements from when the dog is born vs. end of life, how can we represent that data to better understand the trajectory of their lives and also carcinogenesis if applicable. Can we prepare the ICDC for hosting this type of data?Toby and all â€“ What immuno-oncology data to support. Several kinds of data are possible: Nanostring/sequence, immunohistochemistry (immune cell infiltration into tumor microenvironment), flow cytometry (immune cell subsets), serum cytokine levels. For flow cytometry, should raw data files be submitted, which would allow ICDC users to analyze data and draw gates themselves or should processed data be submitted, which would take up less space?Toby - ICDC is a node in the CRDC so not sure non-cancer data is relevant. Aging and NEHES are the closest partners to us to focus on cancer, it will be a stretch to do other things.Amy - Friend from Bristol Meyers Squib reached out to better understand relationships with pharma, maybe we should put together a panel of pharma folks to see if they can have a focus group to determine data and tooling that would be useful to that community.
