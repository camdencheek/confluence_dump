Coordinating that external data between the U01 and U24 is currently out of scope for the DCC.  The DCC data is standardized and they are looking at mapping that to CDISC or some other standard (flexible on which).The UPenn DCC (U24) is using a RedCap data collection system for a subset of the clinical data being captured.  More clinical data is being captured at the U01 sites, however, there is no agreement on standardization of collection mechanisms between the sites.There are ongoing discussions as to whether there is a need to expand the scope of the DCC to cover the data from the other sites.Submission of correlative data at the sites will be standardized to some degree, per Connie.  For example, for flow cytometry, text of descriptions of the antibodies and protocols will be requested followed by prompts for submitting results of flow cytometry tests (e.g. %s of specific immune cell subsets). To obtain more detailed or raw data, users may contact the investigator.The BPSC Imaging working group is working on a Glioma Pilot study of 84 dogs with multiomic data.The BPSC may want to engage PRECINCT as a pilot study for how to standardize the data, once they’ve met with the NCI Semantics team (10/9/19).
