                Maintenance and data will be the base

                Are there specific items that haven&#39;t been attempted in the first 5 years?

              <li>
                Discuss with the Steering committee

                Probably don&#39;t need decisions until next summer (2022)
              </li>
              <li>
                John - Infrastructure is in place, next piece would be comparative analysis?  Are there datasets and/or tools, pipelines, etc.
              </li>
              <li>
                Toby - Would need some specific case studies.  Here&#39;s the hypothesis and this is the data we need.  That would drive the connections.
              </li>
              <li>
                Cloud Resource needs?
              </li>
              <li>
                Cost for data storage will land on ICDC
              </li>
              <li>
                Helping submitters put data into proper format, general submission support
              </li>
              <li>
                Outreach to submitters to get them informed early in their work.  Tools, instructions to help them.
              </li>
              <li>
                Data loading, submission will become more automated
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    Coming primarily from CRDC
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>
                Toby - Would like a list of needs
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    That is a PM task
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>
                Ralph - Would ICDC host reference genomes?  Other ground truth data?  Normal tissue data?
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    NCBI has 5 fully annotated dog genomes
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Elaine and her team are key to this, they have the most experience in normal genomes
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            ICDC was started with the idea of catalyzing the dog community.  Can it expand to provide this standard service?  Be more than just a data commons.
            <ul>
              <li>
                Perhaps something like a forum?
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            Amy - There are examples where consensus have been published.
            <ul>
              <li>
                Just a consensus on a reference genome would be a significant event
              </li>
              <li>
                This area (consensus approaches) is a very unmet need
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            Debbie - compiling information and tools would be very helpful.
          </li>
          <li>
            Amy is working with NCATS to build transcriptional tools, one issue was trying to identify fusions, no current consensus.
            <ul>
              <li>
                A white paper around this would be useful.
              </li>
              <li>
                ICDC Cookbook?
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            Even if the consensus is that there is no reference genome and it needs to be breed-based, that would be a major advancement
          </li>
          <li>
            Is the Dog 10K project a source?  Elaine would be best for information on this
          </li>
          <li>
            Erika - This conversation happened in the Non-Cancer group
            <ul>
              <li>
                VCF files are publicly available
              </li>

                ICDC may need some enhancements but could host this

              <li>
                Toby - No possibility of favoritism, DGAB decides on if it is appropriate, Exec Comm then makes final decision

              <li>
                If the consensus is that their approach isn&#39;t sufficient, that&#39;s a separate question.

                Wait for publication and then decide?

                  <li>
                    That would be just sharing data that have been published

                  <li>
                    Consensus is that waiting for publication is the preferred approach
