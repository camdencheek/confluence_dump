The following is intended to document the QA workflow for the ICDC project. QA will work closely with the Development team using JIRA for documentation and tracking purposes.
<h2 id="QAJIRAWorkflow-ThetypeofJIRAticketsassignedtoQAwillinclude:">
  The type of JIRA tickets assigned to QA will include:
</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    User Stories /Requirements
  </li>
  <li>
    New Features
  </li>
  <li>
    Improvements
  </li>
  <li>
    Bug fixes
  </li>
  <li>
    Test Requests
  </li>
  <li>
    Tasks
  </li>
</ul>
<h2 id="QAJIRAWorkflow-TestingforEachSprint">
  Testing for Each Sprint
</h2>
At the beginning of each sprint, new User Stories, Requirements, Improvements, New Features, Tasks are created. There is an understanding that there are not always requirements available, but if there are expected benchmarks, these should be recorded in JIRA as a requirement to refer to when testing.Once these have been defined and finalized, QA will be notified (via email or comment on the JIRA ticket) to begin review to determine the amount of time that will be needed for testing and test preparation (i.e., creating test cases). This will give QA time to clarify any questions regarding the ticket.Once development has completed, the User Stories, Requirements, Improvements, New Features and Tasks will be assigned to QA to begin testing with a status of “Ready for testing” and a resolution of one of the following:
<ol>
  <li>
    “Fixed”
  </li>
  <li>
    “Won’t Fix”
  </li>
  <li>
    “Duplicate”
  </li>
  <li>
    “Cannot Replicate “
  </li>
</ol>
If testing fails, the status of the ticket will be changed to “Reopened” and assigned back to the developer to fix.If there are bugs found, new bug tickets will be created and linked to the related ticket and assigned to the Development Team.

  Expected Turnaround Time
</h2>
The expected turnaround time for testing is within 24-48 hours but is flexible to change as the project progresses.
