<ul>
  <li>
    Matt/Philip - look into adding associated studies/data sets to an ICDC study such that an investigator will be able to find that data set in another data commons and identify the methods used to analyze that data set (pipelines, etc.) to ensure that any analysis that investigator does with the data is consistent with the original investigator.  Relevant for connecting human study data with canine study data for comparative purposes.
