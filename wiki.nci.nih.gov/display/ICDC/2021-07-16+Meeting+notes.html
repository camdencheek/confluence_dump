TP- Next expected release is Sept. 13th. There is a new multi-study participant feature that illustrates canines that were enrolled in multiple studies, this feature is reliant on metadata, such as the biobank_id to discern this designation. Another feature in progress is the extension of the amount of data available for download through the user interface to be inclusive of all metadata that has been loaded into the data commons, at the moment this extended metatdata is only available through the API. Are there other priorities that we should be aware of? ICDC is aiming for quarterly releases.TH- Do we have any data on the microevironment, anything other than omics type data?TP- We do link out to TCGA and other imaging repositories.TH- We need to capture immune modulators and other types of trials, we need a way of adding that type of data such as treating dogs with various agents, canine biopsies, circulating tumor DNA, etc.CS- Flow data was considered for ICDC. We talked about getting the numbers, but maybe we need to get the raw data. We didn&#39;t address if we would bring in raw flow cytometry data.TP- Nothing prevents us from getting that type of data into our data model.CS- If we could maybe provide small financial support that may help people get over the hump and encourage data submission.TP- Let me talk to Ralph to see if we can find a path to use the honorarium to do this.TH- We are below on spending, we could use that.TP- It may come with a ceiling that we need to live with, but we can try to get a mechanism in place.RP- We do have a mechanism in place that involves a Material Transfer Agreement (MTA), no ceiling on that. We can look into this, it comes out of the legal office, maybe we can set up a conference between the 4 of usTH- Potentially open this up ICDC up to other institutes, the concern is the amount of data that we currently have, we need to get more data ingested and assess the level of interest from other groups. I have a feeling that other institutes do not have this type of platform.AL- The National Institute of Aging has an ongoing study on aging canines, there could be immunological data available.TH- We would need to ensure to tag this type of data so that it is findable by disease type, so that researchers interested in cancer related data could find that data easily.AL- Dog is a good translational model for cardiovascular disease, diabetes, kidney disease, and others.JO- Also for narcolepsy.AL- Additionally, genomic inherited diseases such as renal failure and muscular dystrophy.AL- We are currently working on osteosarcoma whole genome data from clinical specimens and are looking to obtain canine specific bioinformatic support. We need to establish best practices for how canine data is analyzed
