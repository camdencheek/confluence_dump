DOIs for Data SubmissionHarmonization of dataIntegration with Monarch/CD2H (both NCATS programs)SC is not so much interested in the data and more interested in what can be done with the data.The overarching question for NCI is whether pet dogs with spontaneous cancers can serve as close models of human disease in order to evaluate new drugs, immunotherapeutic agents, and combinations for further development for human cancer patients.  Address this question with ICDC:
<ul>
  <li>
    Full genotype and phenotype characterization of the major canine tumors and normal tissues, including tumor mutational burden (TMB) and neoantigens (seen by T cells in the context of canine MHC antigens);
  </li>
  <li>
    Description of the tumor microenvironment (TME), including numbers and types of subsets of immune (and other) cells; and
  </li>
  <li>
    Clinical data from the Comparative Oncology Trials Consortium (COTC) and other canine cancer trials, including images; data from treatment-naïve, post-treatment, and relapse patients; and all other clinical data elements for canines.
  </li>
</ul>
SCWG (End user working group) Goals:
<ol>
  <li>
    compile and curate canine and other datasets with clinical outcomes (if available) for validation exercise and testing
  </li>
  <li>
    to establish a reference genome considering various breeds
  </li>
</ol>
The working group will collect data from the Canine Immunotherapy Trials Network, P30 supplement sites, the National Human Genome Research Institute, and other sites.The SC will work as partners with the system design team to review and modify design and operations and to define and refine data models and end user tools.
