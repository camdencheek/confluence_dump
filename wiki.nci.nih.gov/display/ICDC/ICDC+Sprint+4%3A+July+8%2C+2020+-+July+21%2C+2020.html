*All of these goals have made significant progress this sprint, but haven&#39;t fully passed QA, so none are marked as completed.  They will carry over into the next sprint.  There will be no release this sprint.+This goal was removed from the sprint at the end after discussion about implementation issues and a potential new implementation strategy that is more comprehensive.Retrospective ResultsWhat went well
