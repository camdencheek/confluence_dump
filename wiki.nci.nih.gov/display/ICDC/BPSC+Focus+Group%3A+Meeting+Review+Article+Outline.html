  Goals
</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    Publish a paper to flank Dog 10K, first design and test methodologies and applicability to precision medicine, second would be an overview of how the tools and resources for analyzing genomic data is changing (here are datasets that can be used, basic resources, guides, the new reference genome, etc.) solves the issue of calling variants differently, there is not an overall blueprint for analysis best practices and the space is filled with differing interpretations. This paper would not be prescriptive, it would be a review of available tools and datasets. The paper would be a Best Practices paper.

Goal- Overview of the field associated with canine cancer genetics (rapidly evolving). Tools that are available, examples of how they are used, discussion on background of resources available to interrogate the data.Â Motivation - provide impetus for canine researchers to collect samples and data from canine patientsTarget Journal - Publishes widely read review articles, Frontiers, JNCI, PLosGeneticsTarget Audience - Human and canine researchers
