    SC meeting was held on the 17th and Elaine Ostrander presented on genomic data she has collected for specific breeds. This was enthusatically discussed by the SC and several questions remain to be answered including how and if we should link that data into ICDC.

    Have acquired complete data from Glioma, including BAMS and index files. Data release is only waiting on new BAMs from NCATS. We are weighing the pros and cons of releasing the updated metadata and new Glioma study while retaining the old NCATS data for now.

    Functionality release is in final QA testing and we have started the next functional sprint where we will start adding sample views to the data.
