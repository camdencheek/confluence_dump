SC is looking at mechanisms for increasing visibility in the community and exploring the system capabilities. SBG has been invited to give a demonstration next month and then they will conduct some analyses and provide feedback to our team. Besides the two posters planned for the end of this month and middle of October, several other conferences were suggested and Purdue has posted a couple of stories about us. More stories on other sites are planned.Data team is still coordinating with NCATS to get the final files and the other studies continue to make progress. 25 TB of data are available at SBG from the Glioma data set. A new pulmonary adenocarcinoma study has been identified and the submitter has confirmed they wil submit to the DGAB.System team is planning a release for Sept. 30 which will include security updates, search engine optimization, static page updates and the first steps to migrating to the Bento platform. We are cross-pollinating our efforts with the Bento team and providing ideas, as well as incorporating their simplified configuration mechanisms - this will lead to increased efficiency for both teams and higher quality control across all data commons that use Bento.
