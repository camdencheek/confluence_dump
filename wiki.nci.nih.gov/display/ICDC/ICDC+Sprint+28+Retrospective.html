    We are getting pretty good setting up code to read from environment variables and repos to have branches that mimic our tiers so that we can manage web content more efficiently. Thanks to

    We could have done an analysis of the code a little bit early to match the requirements of the new node design which could have provided us with a few clear answers. But Thanks to

    Not liking scrum being dropped on two consecutive Wednesdays, although today&#39;s cancellation is a bit of special case with an early release.  As one of our primary touchpoints, in my opinion, scrum should be scrum, not rolled into other meetings (

    Met with others to gain consensus on common terminology across the Bento tech stack. I feel this will help all projects so that we are not developing in a silo and so that we can build cohesive features, services, and products. (

    Learned that some of the formatting which I thought might be overpowering is surprisingly subtle depending upon the font being used within the UI (

    Learned that the ReadMe modal itself could use a little styling to enhance the readability of what is quite a lengthy text, at least for the DMN ReadMe (
