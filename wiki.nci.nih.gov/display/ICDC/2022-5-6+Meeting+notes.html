Toby - Can canine bladder cancer be a good model for invasive human bladder cancer? Maybe running differential expression in dogs at various stages vs. human data at different stages of disease obtained from the GDC and then comparing expression patterns and gene signatures. Real focus is comparative genomics.Ralph - Possibly raise as a discussion point to the SC. Does this cancer in both species survive therapy to resist disease using same pathways? Is there biological convergence?Toby - Look at dogs in ICDC and see what the genes are in dogs that are more resistant to glioma vs. dogs that are not and see if those up or down regulated genes have human homologs.Toby - Real data in ICDC can now be used to answer real biological questions.Ralph - Will put use case into SC meeting agenda.

1. Genomic correlates across platforms (DNA, RNA, protein).2. Correlating multi-omics data with clinical annotation and phenotypes, particularly outcomes.3. Comparative analyses of canine and human. Examples include:1. Search for conserved mutations between canine and human tumors2. Disease diagnosis (e.g. cancer type) and classification mapping between canines and humans5. Gene expression changes and mutational profiles associated with therapeutic response and outcome6. How do sporadic tumors in non-human mammals compare to sporadic human tumors?7. Correlations and model building from radiomic and pathomic features extracted from medical and histopathologic images with outcomes and genomics, as is currently being widely done with human images8. Develop biomarkers of response and resistance in humans by analyzing the responses and genomic signatures in dogs.

Toby - Regarding the Focus Group Discussions so far, parallel data between canine and humans from the same treatment, cell sub-types before and after treatment, environmental insults in canines vs. humans (exposures for humans cause cancer, canines subjected to same exposures), urothelial cancers in human vs. canine (Knapp lab has studied this), looking for data beyond genomics data.Debbie - Lots of groups showing interest, proteomic data coming, others will mine the data we are generating.Toby - Adverse events in canines in clinical trials, important for comparison to human. Warren brought up flea and tick medications and this can be absorbed by their human companions and be linked to cancer. Connie suggested looking at raw flow cytometry data, this data can be used to make predictions. The NanoString data will be coming and will introduce data model expansions. Potential to involve pharma.Connie - Possibly the aging study, involves all breeds.Toby - Waiting to hear from Dan Promislow and to determine if he has had communications with the Aging Institute will co-fund with the NCI looking at canine tumors and conducting sequencing. Need to secure this before the end of the fiscal year in order to use the funding.Toby - Genomics Working group and the Imaging Working group is part of the BPSC, Data Governance Advisory Board is separate led by Warren Kibbe.Action items
