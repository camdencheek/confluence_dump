        What Worked
      </td>
      <td>
        The idea of manually defined, static but real/realistic seed data being used to generate tsv files with which to pre-configure structure around studies, study arms, and corresponding cohorts. This has given us a robust, scalable mechanism via which to quickly create a realistic study landscape that we can then import subjects and their clinical data into. We should extend this approach in Sprint 3 and mechanize the associated generation of tsv files.

      <td>
        Ye being able to iterate the data model in real time during our initial data loads allowed us to immediately address gaps in properties associated with target nodes, and/or fully align field nomenclature before trying to load a given set of data. The pay off from Mark&#39;s extra effort on the Make Model tool was huge.

        Use of manually-contrived values for Submitter ID in all nodes downstream of Cycle, rather than IDs derived from actual data values using Pentaho-based transformations. They worked in terms of allowing data imports in the extreme short term, but simply don&#39;t represent a realistic, scalable solution.
