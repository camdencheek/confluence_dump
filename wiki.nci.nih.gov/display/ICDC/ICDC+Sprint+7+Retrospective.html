    Tremendous job by the QA team in finding bugs, especially ones that are not obvious to find (

    I liked the team collaboration and communication specially when we find issues in the code freeze build they were tackled very efficiently . I loved the code freeze and final build , as we did not get any last min extra builds

    Efficient and clear communication to get bugs fixed right before code freeze and passed on to QA. Go team!

    Multiple improvements to the newly-implemented Sample Profiles were well executed, and have greatly improved the functionality of the visualizations

    Our collective decision to err very much on the side of caution, and call an early end to the sprint, was clearly a very good, albeit (Captain) obvious decision

    From QA point of view, I did not see anything we lacked. If anything we were very efficient in tackling major last min issues .

    Technically, although not directly related to the sprint to which this retro board refers, I learned that having someone who did not write the user stories in question read them for the first time, slowly and very deliberately, during our initial sprint pre-planning to be very illuminating. It serves as an early pressure test as to them having the right level of detail and being clear and understandable
