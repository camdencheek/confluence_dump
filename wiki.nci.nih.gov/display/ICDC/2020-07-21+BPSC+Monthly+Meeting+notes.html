        Imaging Working Group (Paula/Amy) Goals: The overarching objective of this WG is to provide the comparative cancer research community with guidelines and best practices for the collection, formatting and reporting of imaging data collected from canine companion animals with naturally-occurring cancers into the Integrated Canine Data Commons (ICDC). This is to facilitate the utilization and analysis of such data by stakeholders in the cancer research community to facilitate dog-to-human translational research and advancement of knowledge in the comparative space.
