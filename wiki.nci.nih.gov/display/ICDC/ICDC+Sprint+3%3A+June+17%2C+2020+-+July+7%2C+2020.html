Amit: stumbled a bit on release; &#34;prd&#34; instead of &#34;prod&#34;. Setup process to mitigate this in the future. Meeting with SBG tomorrow to talk about new data. Internal disagreements resolved. No new data after July 22.Dimitri: thanks Dev team for patience. For new sprint, starting with Phil&#39;s user stories. Gayathri: nothing for this sprint.Karan: nothing visual. Candidates for tables explored.Laxmi: thanks to Megan and Gayathri for testing multiple times. Able to adjust. Want to avoid making same mistakes twice - GitHub page didn&#39;t deploy correctly. According to Amit: stage: YAML wasn&#39;t updated, Prod: URL wasn&#39;t pointed correctly. Different mistakes. Need to design formalized process (separate release process for static pages).Megan: nothing for this sprint.Philip: Model changes, including UBC01 data from Debbie Knapp - went in really easy. New program gremlins discovered - same image for both Programs page and Program Detail page for all programs - need to be able to specify in the future. Good to see that new programs work the way that we originally expected (gremlins aside). Huge thanks to Claire and Ming.Yizhen: no feedback on this sprint.John: Glue that pulls it all together is how we work together. In next sprint, need to be aware that we can phone each other and keep up the communication. Need to trust that all team members have the best interests of the projects at heart. Video calls sometimes too. Trying to move very fast, need to make sure we&#39;re still functioning as a team. John&#39;s &#34;door&#34; is always open.Retrospective ResultsWhat went well
