    Getting the new function whereby end users can download a set of example data loading files coded up, tested and out in our most recent software release, despite the requirement to support the function surfaced relatively late in the release cycle. Nice work

    Really liked the decision to no longer require any review of PR&#39;s concerning changes to static content that are pushing changes only to the Dev tier. It effectively results in the ability to perform real-time review of the changes made as they&#39;ll be displayed within the application&#39;s UI, saving a lot of time when having to repeatedly iterate the source files to fix minor issue that can really only be seen in situ (

    It was relatively simple to get and parse the additional image collection data provided by the IDC API so that the interop service can provide more useful data. It&#39;s not done yet, but I&#39;m guessing doing the same for TCIA collections will also be easy. Thanks

    Getting two embargo records pushed up through Stage and onto our Production environment courtesy of the Cloud One team took far too long considering the trivial nature of the records that needed to be loaded, and the simplicity of the loading task. Very much wish we could still perform these loads for ourselves, completely independently of Cloud One (

    Â More about the Data Repository Service (DRS) which is a generic interface to data repositories so consumers can access data in a single way regardless of how the data is stored or managed. DRS uses URIs or Uniform Resource Identifiers in API calls to their server to fetch data objects. (

    Finally learned how to make updates to the ICDC&#39;s static content pages. Using Visual Studio with the word wrap function turned on made viewing the rather cumbersome YAML files relatively easy (

    Also learned, or at least confirmed what I expected the process by which changes to static content are promoted up through the ICDC&#39;s various environments to look like (
