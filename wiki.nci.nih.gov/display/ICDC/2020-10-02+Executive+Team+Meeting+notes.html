        Conversations were had regarding possible options to facilitate one or more papers about ICDC.  Mine the data and answer one or more questions of translational value.  1) Could do bladder cancer paper (UBC01) - dependent on data coming out of embargo - still in review at Genentech. Could be a few months still, until publication.2) Could do a bladder cancer paper (UBC02) - not embargo dependent, but hasn&#39;t yet been submitted.3) Could do a paper with the larger neuro group that Amy previously suggested.  Unsure how much time would be required to assemble that group and get the research completed.4) Could do a smaller, brain-cancer paper based on GLIOMA01 data in ICDC already. Unsure how that would be received by the larger group. Tim Bentley at Purdue?Amy: Large neuro group is potentially slow moving.  Smaller more focused group might be more nimble, however, the authors on GLIOMA01 should be given right of first refusal for secondary analysis. Amy and Debbie to come up with a letter inviting authors (Samir Amin, Roel Verhaak, John Levine).

        Following on discussions about options to visualize the data in ICDC, Erika/Matt have met with Mark Jensen to begin exploring options.  Short-term and long-term options being explored. IGV integration from Broad being explored. May be ready in Nov. or Dec. Exec. Team Meeting.  Will lead to solicitation of additional suggestions.

        SC meeting next week will include SBG demo of how to go from ICDC to their platform and do analysis.When publications are submitted - how do we state that the data is ready to be shared?  Implies the need for a DOI for the paper. CBIIT has a DOI minting mechanism.
