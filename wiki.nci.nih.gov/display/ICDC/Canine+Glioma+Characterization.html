Nature of the studyThis is a Comparative Oncology Program (COP) comprehensive characterization of spontaneous treatment-naïve canine glioma in pet dogs, which encompasses MRI, histopathology, immunohistochemistry (IHC), and molecular phenotyping (WGS, WES, RNAseq, methylation profiling).  It was conducted with both intramural NCI (LeBlanc/CCR) and extramural NCI (DCTD/P30 supplements to designated cancer center grants) funding over the course of the last 3 years. The intent was to determine the translatability of canine gliomas to their human counterparts e.g. which subtypes exist, how can they be defined/characterized, and to what human subtypes do they relate to based on the histopathologic, clinical, and molecular features.Sample typesn = 85 dog tumorsScanned H&amp;E images at 40 x magnification (all) – I have these on a hard driveScanned IHC images (a subset have an IHC panel of 5 markers – I’m still working on that part; I have the images on a hard drive)Baseline MRIs (most all of the 85 dogs had MRI imaging – I’m going school by school to verify that as part of the imaging WG; we will curate according to Paula’s recommendations)Cases: Univ of CA-Davis team has 22 MRIs

). Roel Verhaak worked with the P30 awardees to generate the molecular data. The MRIs are property of the vet schools who submitted the case material for the pathology and molecular profiling initiatives. Assuming all of them will be ok with submitting to ICDC for the set to be complete across all datatypes.Univ of CA-Davis team:Peter J Dickinson &lt;
