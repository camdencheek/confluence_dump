    2022 Q2 Software Release on April 4th!!! Nice job by all (

    With the OSA01 fully on-boarded onto our DEV tier, and with the submitter preview successfully completed, we&#39;ve finally been able to push the study up to the QA tier for formal testing, and therefore release in the immediate future

    Although the bug-fest that erupted on the Thursday and Friday immediately prior to our planned Production release was unwelcome to say the least, I think we should give ourselves some credit for the way we triaged the situation, such that we could still release only days later, even if the release process itself still went sideways

    The process by which we&#39;re now handling the iteration of designs and the review and sign-off process for them. From my perspective it&#39;s working really well

    The data model explorer&#39;s data loading template and PDF export functions hitting Production with near perfect timing relative to upcoming data submissions. Our timing couldn&#39;t have been much closer to perfect and major stakeholders are very clear on the impact of the functionality in question

    Despite plenty of discussion around our plans, the final deployments to the Stage environment, and even more so to the Production environment, were poorly coordinated

    Discovering major bugs, albeit edge cases, in new functionality only after our Production release is disappointing. Thankfully, the functionalities of the data model explorer most critical to data submission, i.e. the table view downloads, were not impacted by these issues

    Quicker turn over of design fixes prompted by Design Reviews, whether it is done within the same Sprint as Design Review submission or the next Sprint. When time between review and fix is elongated, it requires relearning or getting reacquainted with all the requested changes which makes the process cumbersome
