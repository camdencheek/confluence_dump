27 May 2020Completed Development sprint - no release yet, but significant progress on new data (Glioma data transferred from NCBI, BAM files being created by Greg Tawa), study associated files, adding cases directly to the cart.Steering Committee Meeting on 5-20 - One interesting thing we discovered during the DGAB meeting in May is that there is a Canine Comparative Oncology Group Consortium (CCOGC) which allows investigators to use their samples for studies.  Some of these samples made it into studies already prioritized at ICDC and so we established a need to support multiple sample identifiers for each sample. In addition, the BPSC is preparing a document on genomic pipeline recommendations.  Continuing to seek out new sources of data by reaching out to grant holders.  As we do, we find that some of the grant holders are submitting together under one study and are working to understand the relationships to document them correctly.
