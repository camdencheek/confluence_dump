    Appreciate the continuous brainstorming for improvements and hawk-like detail catching from Phil, recently in regards to the Data Model Explorer. It has transformed vastly from where it used to be.

    Great coordination around getting a very late-breaking fix to the OSA01 study description from the study owners and into place, such that we could still push the study to Production within the confines of Sprint 18
