EK - Collected use cases in 2019 before any data was in ICDC. Around 8 use cases were documented. Many of the responses included high-level, overarching concepts. To uncover the real scientific use cases we nee do talk with PostDcos and Grad Students.TH- Comparative Oncology community will be interested in specific questions.EK- NCPI has a team comprised of NHLBI, NCI, Common Fund, and NHGRI to provide use cases of interoperability across the platforms and cloud resources. We are exploring congenital cancer in Gliomas, we might be able to add canine glioma data to identify any correlations that may exist. Use cases are in the works. We solicited researchers to get the scientific use cases.TH- Longitudinal studies can be very useful in dogs. We can use that data to draw comparisons in humans. We will probably give some funding to the Dog Aging Study that may be matched by the Dog Aging Institute. They have ~30k dogs they are following, healthy dogs, many develop cancer. They are willing to sequence if they had the funding.JO- Valuable just to have healthy, normal dogs as well. Could they be a source for deposit into ICDC?TH- Reference standards are prolific at this point. There is a new canine reference German Shepherd 1.0 named Mischka.

1. Genomic correlates across platforms (DNA, RNA, protein).2. Correlating multi-omics data with clinical annotation and phenotypes, particularly outcomes.3. Comparative analyses of canine and human. Examples include:1. Search for conserved mutations between canine and human tumors2. Disease diagnosis (e.g. cancer type) and classification mapping between canines and humans5. Gene expression changes and mutational profiles associated with therapeutic response and outcome6. How do sporadic tumors in non-human mammals compare to sporadic human tumors?7. Correlations and model building from radiomic and pathomic features extracted from medical and histopathologic images with outcomes and genomics, as is currently being widely done with human images8. Develop biomarkers of response and resistance in humans by analyzing the responses and genomic signatures in dogs.

DK- Data may be coming into ICDC from the Promislow and Rod Page from Colorado State.TH- In the Aging study are they looking at specific breeds?DK- Several represented. Working heavily with the Broad and data made available there. The cancer data may be available to be deposited into ICDC.EK- One of the reasons we pushed for user research on canine is we have a lot of flexibility to make improvements. It will be interesting to do this at this stage and then possibly again in the future. Please send relevant questions for the study if they exist.RP- We may need NCI to take a look that the MTA once it is drafted. Claudia Hayward has been working with this on us.TH- I can make arrangements for that.RP- Not an acquisition, just a reimbursement.TH- NCI should at least take a look and give their approval. Regarding tech transfer, will commercial companies use this data? Is there an issue with a commercial company using ICDC data to make a product? EK- Data use guidelines are coming soon.TH- Keep these policies consistent with other data commons.TH- Need to start seriously thinking about the next Task Order. We need a small group to brainstorm and present to the Executive Committee and then the Steering Committee. Not sure if Debbie can be involved because she is external. I propose myself, Connie, Erika, and Ralph. I&#39;m not getting any feedback from anyone about what they think we should be doing. CS- Maybe include Elaine, to include a non-cancer perspective.TH- Let&#39;s plan for mid-November. Can we talk more with John Otridge and determine his role. What about Anju? I will reach out to Anju.TH- All authors working with canines will now know if they have additional data.AL- We have many folks in the SC that may have pipelines that exist, others may be willing to share their pipelines.CS- I have a grantee that we should talk with about sharing pipelenAL- Not many people understand molecular implications of canine lymphoma, little cross-validation of IHc. Not fair to say they don&#39;t match, the right set of tools is needed. 30% of case load is Lymphoma. Such a diverse disease.
