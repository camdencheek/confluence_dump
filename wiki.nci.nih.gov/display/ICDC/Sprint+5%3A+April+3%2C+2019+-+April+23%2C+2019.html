        Matthew B, Apr 23 2019 - Perhaps one weekly team meeting with everyone and no standups? Matthew B, Apr 23 2019 - Will continue with 2 standups per week, including all team members.  Members need to close/update tickets as soon as possible so that scrum can be faster.  Leads will attend sprint planning meetings.  Retrospectives will be cut down to 15 min and members will enter thoughts earlier (two days before end of sprint).
