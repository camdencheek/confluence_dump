It is expected that all team members will discuss issues in a free and open manner within FNL.  Each member of the team is valued, brings their experience and knowledge to the table, and is to be treated with respect.  It is expected that all team members will participate in discussions and will contribute their ideas to develop the best product possible.  Once team decisions have been made, the Project Manager will present those ideas in clear and unified manner to the sponsor and others.  If issues need to be escalated, the Project Manager will be responsible for doing so.It is expected that FNL staff will work in a collaborative and complementary manner to NCI and that appropriate NCI staff will be involved in many of the team meetings.
