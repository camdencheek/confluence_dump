    The team has continued to adapt to Ambar&#39;s transition off ICDC onto Bento refactoring work, with Eric also picking up significant work that would otherwise be in Ming&#39;s hands. (

    has done a really nice job implementing the Interop microservice and it has been fun to observe this service evolve and gain a better understanding of how this can adapt to other repos and APIs that are integrated in the future (

    It was nice to see attendance by some of our engineers at the CRDC meeting, I think it helps us to understand how important our work is and how it all fits together in the broader Cancer Research Data Commons (CRDC). (

    Communication as always is a strong point of the team. When it comes to testing, if I run into any issues - those concerns are always addressed promptly and thoroughly. (

    Very disappointed to see all 6 of the studies actively being on-boarded stall to a greater or lesser degree, pretty much all at the same time. (

    Equally disappointed by the lack of tactical help from TCIA that I tried to get for Jim Dattilo such that he faces no unnecessary complications in getting the PRECINCT01 MRI images submitted, given that he&#39;s already wrangling the data for two PRECINCT studies. (

    Updating Test Cases as changes are being made. This will prevent having to question/second-guess whether a test is passing or failing. (

    I learned that we may be getting a content management system that could help us to improve how static content is managed (
