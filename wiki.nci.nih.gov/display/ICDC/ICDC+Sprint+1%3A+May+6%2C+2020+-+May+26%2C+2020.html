*All of these goals have made significant progress this sprint, but haven&#39;t fully passed QA, so none are marked as completed.  They will carry over into the next sprint.  There will be no release this sprint.Retrospective ResultsWhat went well

Thanks to Claire for final polishing on Glioma/NCATS/COTC and now Vem study. Model updates need coordinating with that. Seeing some progress, new model deployed without huge breaks in API.
