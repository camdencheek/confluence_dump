The DTP AIDS Antiviral Screen has checked tens of thousands of compounds for evidence of anti-HIV activity. Available are screening results and chemical structural data on compounds that are not covered by a confidentiality agreement.

  Screening Results (May 2004 Release)
</h3>
The results of the screening tests are evaluated and placed in one of three categories:
<ul>
  <li>
    CA - Confirmed active
  </li>
  <li>
    CM - Confirmed moderately active
  </li>
  <li>
    CI - Confirmed inactive
  </li>
</ul>

        A &gt; in this field indicates that this happened in at least one of the experiments.

NOTE: the conclusion data was determined by inspection of individual dose response curves and is an overall judgment by trained personnel. The EC50 and IC50 data are computer generated averages and don&#39;t necessarily capture everything that was considered when making the judgement.

The 2D structure (connection table) for each of the 42,390 compounds was retrieved from the DTP&#39;s Drug Information System. Conversion to a 3D structure was accomplished using the program

, created by Prof. Gasteiger&#39;s group.Note: No stereochemical information was used in the build, nor was any geometry optimization performed. Please take these facts into account when deciding if these 3D coordinates are suitable for your particular use.The data are presented in a compressed ASCII file in MDL&#39;s SDFile format. There are 2 data fields included in the SD file:
<ol>
  <li>
    NSC - the NCI&#39;s internal ID number.
  </li>
  <li>
    CAS_RN - the CAS Registry Number when known or 999-99-9 meaning the actual number is unknown.
  </li>
</ol>
Caution: The structural data file is almost 29MB compressed and about 140MB uncompressed. The file is compressed with the standard Unix compress program which is widely available for all platforms. The standard Netscape setting trys to uncompress the file on the fly and display it when the file has the usual .Z type, so I given it a file type .BIN to make sure Netscape asks you to write it directly to disk. You will probably have to rename the file from aidso99sd.bin to aidso99sd.Z to uncompress after which you should have an ASCII file in MDL SD file format.
