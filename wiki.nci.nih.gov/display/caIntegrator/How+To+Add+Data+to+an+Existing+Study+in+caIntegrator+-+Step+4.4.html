4.4. The &#39;Edit Sample Mappings&#39; page displays a list of unmapped  samples, followed by another list mapping sample IDs to subject IDs. As  you can see, the mapping list is empty, which means that none of the  samples in this source have been mapped yet! The list of unmapped  samples appears under the heading &#39;Unmapped Samples&#39; and subheading  &#39;Sample Name&#39;. The numbers in this list represent the sample IDs of the  unmapped samples.
