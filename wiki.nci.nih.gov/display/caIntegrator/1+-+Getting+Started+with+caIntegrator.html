  About caIntegrator
</h2>
NCI Center for Biomedical Informatics and Information Technology (CBIIT) is developing a novel translational informatics platform called caIntegrator that allows researchers and bioinformaticians to access and analyze subject annotation and experimental data across multiple subject annotation trials and studies. The caIntegrator framework provides a mechanism for integrating and aggregating biomedical research data and provides access to a variety of data types (for example, immunohistochemistry (IHC), microarray-based gene expression, SNPs, subject annotation trials data, imaging data, etc.) in a cohesive fashion.caIntegrator is a web based or locally installed portal that allows researchers and study managers to access the biomedical informatics infrastructure and data analysis tools established by caIntegrator from one common software platform. As a caIntegrator user, you can perform the following tasks:
<ul>
  <li>
    Integrate subject annotation data with genomic and/or imaging data
  </li>
  <li>
    Import data of various types in a predefined flat format, and create new studies with multiple study data
  </li>
  <li>
    Update an existing study to add new attributes or to add/modify data
  </li>
  <li>
    Perform analyses on study data
  </li>
</ul>

  Registering as a New caIntegrator User
</h2>
To request a caIntegrator account, you must register as a new user, completing the following steps:
<ol>
  <li>
    Go to the
    <a href="http://caIntegrator.nci.nih.gov" rel="nofollow">
      CBIIT caIntegrator login page
    </a>
    or use the URL provided by your System Administrator for the caIntegrator instance at your institution.
  </li>
  <li>
    Click the Register Now hypertext link, under the caIntegrator login section in the lower center of the page. This opens the account registration form.
  </li>
  <li>
    Enter the appropriate information. Fields with an asterisk are required.

          <td>
            An LDAP account is a user profile you may have with your institution or CBIIT. If you answer Yes, enter your username and password. This allows caIntegrator to verify that your credentials are correct.   If caIntegrator does not validate your LDAP profile, you are asked to reenter your credentials. You can choose to answer No. In this case, the System Administrator will manually ensure that you do not get a duplicate LDAP account during provisioning. You can then cancel the action or talk with your System Administrator about the problem.  If you select No (you do not have an LDAP account), the text boxes for entering the LDAP account information disappear. You must indicate the role you would like to be assigned in caIntegrator, and continue entering the appropriate information in the Account Details section.Not logged in?After you submit your registration request, you can continue to use caIntegrator without an account to browse and search available data while your account is verified and activated.

</ul>
<ul>
  <li>
    Use the customary steps to log into caIntegrator. If your login is successful, the Welcome to Browse/Study page appears.
  </li>
</ul>
Single Sign-on (SSO).If your local installation of caIntegrator is configured with single sign-on, when you click the login button, you are redirected to the single sign-on login page hosted by a separate SSO server. Once you enter your credentials there, you are logged into both caIntegrator and caArray. You can navigate between the two applications without being challenged to provide login credentials again.
<ul>
  <li>
    If SSO is not enabled, continue working in caIntegrator after you log-in as you always have done.
  </li>
  <li>
    If SSO is enabled, you might want to check for data updates in caArray upon user login. This is applicable only to studies that you have access to.
