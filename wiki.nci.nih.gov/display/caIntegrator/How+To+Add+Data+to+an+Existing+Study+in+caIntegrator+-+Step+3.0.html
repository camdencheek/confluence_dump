3.0. We can&#39;t query the study unless it&#39;s already been deployed. To check whether this is the case, scroll all the way down to the bottom of the &#39;Edit Study&#39; page, where you&#39;ll see a row of three buttons. If the study has been deployed, as is the case in our example, the left button labeled &#39;Deploy Study&#39; will be grayed out and you will not be able to click on it. If, however, the study hasn&#39;t been deployed, the button will appear normally, and you can click on it to deploy the study.

The bottom of the &#39;Edit Study&#39; page shows the &#39;Deploy Study&#39; button (highlighted in red). In this example, the study has already been deployed so this button is grayed out. If your study hasn&#39;t yet been deployed, the button will appear normally, and you can click on it to deploy the study.
