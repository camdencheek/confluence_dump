  Solution
</h2>
caIntegrator allows users to query studies by both clinical annotation data (i.e., subject age and gender) and by gene expression data (i.e., numerical reporter IDs representing gene expression levels). When displaying the results for a compound query, caIntegrator can display either the annotation data or the gene expression data individually, but it lacks the ability to display the two together side-by-side. This how-to guide presents two different workarounds for this limitation. The first, and less sophisticated workaround, involves manually exporting the annotation and expression data separately as spreadsheet files, then merging the two spreadsheets afterwards. The second workaround, only available with caIntegrator version 1.3 or later, involves visualizing the data in the form of color-coded maps via a newly added featured known as the Integrative Genomics Viewer (IGV).

  Querying the Data
</h3>
First, let&#39;s do a sample query of a caIntegrator study to illustrate the limitations in displaying query results. In our example, the study we will query is entitled &#39;TCGA Ovarian&#39;, which is selected in the &#39;Public Studies&#39; drop-down list at the top of the caIntegrator home page. To start querying, click on the &#39;Search TCGA Ovarian&#39; link in the navigation menu at the left.

<h3 id="caInt0013HowToCombineAnnotationandGeneExpressionDataWhenDisplayingQueryResults-Workaround1:ManuallyExportingSpreadsheets">
  Workaround 1: Manually Exporting Spreadsheets
</h3>
So far, we&#39;ve seen that caIntegrator can display annotation and gene expression query results individually, but not side-by-side. One workaround for this limitation is to manually export the annotation and expression data separately as spreadsheet files, then merge the two spreadsheets afterwards. To begin, let&#39;s go back to the &#39;Query Results&#39; tab for the annotation results type and click on the &#39;Export to CSV&#39; button at the bottom left.
<img alt="illustration of step" height="315" width="575" src="https://wiki.nci.nih.gov/download/attachments/embedded-page/caIntegrator/caInt%200013%20-%20How%20To%20Combine%20Annotation%20and%20Gene%20Expression%20Data%20When%20Displaying%20Query%20Results/worddavfe075777c67734344a64f2cbf2f35c47.png?api=v2">
A dialog will then appear prompting you whether you want to open or save the CSV file. Click on the &#39;Save File&#39; button, then click on &#39;OK&#39; below it.
<img alt="Screenshot of file dialog showing how to save exported CSV file" height="281" width="402" src="https://wiki.nci.nih.gov/download/attachments/embedded-page/caIntegrator/caInt%200013%20-%20How%20To%20Combine%20Annotation%20and%20Gene%20Expression%20Data%20When%20Displaying%20Query%20Results/worddav2b2bc02362051b46d045c2ff62220ee4.png?api=v2">
Another dialog will then appear prompting you for the name and location of the saved file. Choose a convenient location to save the file to from the drop-down list at the top, then enter &#39;AnnotationResults.csv&#39; for the file name and click on the &#39;Save&#39; button.
<img alt="Screenshot of dialog showing how to specify filename for exported CSV file" height="411" width="562" src="https://wiki.nci.nih.gov/download/attachments/embedded-page/caIntegrator/caInt%200013%20-%20How%20To%20Combine%20Annotation%20and%20Gene%20Expression%20Data%20When%20Displaying%20Query%20Results/worddavbeb77685905584eb8034bbba264d0e6a.png?api=v2">
Next, let&#39;s open the CSV file we just saved in a spreadsheet application. In this guide, we&#39;ll use Microsoft Excel 2003. A partial screenshot of the Excel window is shown below. The spreadsheet consists of two columns: &#39;Subject ID&#39; and &#39;Gender&#39;.
<img alt="Screenshot of Microsoft Excel window showing query results from exported CSV file." height="233" width="247" src="https://wiki.nci.nih.gov/download/attachments/embedded-page/caIntegrator/caInt%200013%20-%20How%20To%20Combine%20Annotation%20and%20Gene%20Expression%20Data%20When%20Displaying%20Query%20Results/worddav77d077d6af745eacd79ec0481dcfc9ea.png?api=v2">
Now, go back to the &#39;Query Results&#39; tab for the gene expression results type and click on the &#39;Export to CSV&#39; button at the bottom left.
<img alt="Screenshot of &#39;Query Results&#39; tab showing how to export gene expression query results to a CSV file" height="346" width="575" src="https://wiki.nci.nih.gov/download/attachments/embedded-page/caIntegrator/caInt%200013%20-%20How%20To%20Combine%20Annotation%20and%20Gene%20Expression%20Data%20When%20Displaying%20Query%20Results/worddav6e574f5f4ffac8754e49a9f214822457.png?api=v2">
Then, repeat the steps we followed previously to save the resulting CSV file as &#39;genomicResults.CSV&#39; and open it in Excel. A partial screenshot of the Excel window is shown below. The spreadsheet consists of four columns: &#39;Subject ID&#39;, &#39;Sample ID&#39;, &#39;Gene Name&#39;, and &#39;BRCA1&#39;. Since the &#39;Gene Name&#39; column is empty, we can delete it, leaving three columns.

Now, highlight the entire contents of the spreadsheet (527 rows total), then select &#39;Copy&#39; from the &#39;Edit&#39; menu.

Finally, switch back to the &#39;AnnotationResults.csv&#39; spreadsheet, click on the empty cell to the right of the &#39;Gender&#39; column heading, and select &#39;Paste&#39; from the &#39;Edit&#39; menu.

  Workaround 2: The Integrated Genomics Viewer (IGV)
</h3>
The other workaround for caIntegrator&#39;s limited options for displaying query results is a newly added featured known as the Integrative Genomics Viewer (IGV), which allows the annotation and expression data to be visualized side-by-side in the form of color-coded maps. To begin using the IGV, switch back to the &#39;Results Type&#39; tab on the &#39;Search TCGA Ovarian&#39; page and click on the &#39;Integrative Genomics Viewer&#39; button under the &#39;Select Results Type&#39; heading.
<img alt="Screenshot of &#39;Results Type&#39; tab showing Integrative Genomics Viewer&#39; option" height="88" width="575" src="https://wiki.nci.nih.gov/download/attachments/embedded-page/caIntegrator/caInt%200013%20-%20How%20To%20Combine%20Annotation%20and%20Gene%20Expression%20Data%20When%20Displaying%20Query%20Results/worddavd62dba8b7f64174ae2f508e22042ca5a.png?api=v2">
Next, check off &#39;gender&#39; in the scrollable list box under the &#39;patient&#39; heading, and finally, click on the &#39;View in Integrative Genomics Viewer&#39; button at the bottom.
