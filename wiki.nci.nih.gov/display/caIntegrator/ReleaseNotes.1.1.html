Draft release notes for caIntegrator2 v 1.1:
<ul>
  <li>
    Prior to release v1.1, if you already have caIntegrator2 installed and used the graphical wizard to install it, you&#39;ll need to make a change before upgrading to v 1.1.  Go to JBOSS_HOME\jboss-4.0.5.GA\bindings and open up bindings.xml and change this line:
    &lt;server name=&#34;ports-01&#34;&gt; to be &lt;server name=&#34;bda-ports&#34;&gt;
  </li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>
    If the user is upgrading an existing caIntegrator2 installation and previously loaded a Affymetrix GeneChip Human Mapping 100K platform, this platform is only supported as Copy Number Data Type.  Otherwise, the Affymetrix GeneChip Human Mapping 100K platform will not be supported until a future release.
  </li>
</ul>

    If caIntegrator2 is integrated with NBIA, and the HTTP port is different than NCI CBIIT grid port, they will not be able to view images in NBIA basket.
