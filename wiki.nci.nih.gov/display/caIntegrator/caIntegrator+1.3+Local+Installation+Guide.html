<h4 id="caIntegrator1.3LocalInstallationGuide-ApacheAntEnvironmentVariables">
  Apache Ant Environment Variables
</h4>
Reason for setting variablesThe purpose of setting operating system environment variables is so that the Java SDK and Ant build tool are available to run from anywhere in the system.
<h5 id="caIntegrator1.3LocalInstallationGuide-Linux">
  Linux
</h5>
Variables in LinuxThe JAVA_HOME, ANT_HOME and PATH environment variables are set in /etc/profile. You may need to create the variables, or modify them if they already exist.To set the environmental variables in Linux, follow these steps:
<ol>
  <li>
    As the root user, enter the following in the /etc/profile file. A PATH variable should already be created in this file, so be sure to define the JAVA_HOME and ANT_HOME export before the PATH export. Replace &lt;some_path&gt; with the correct path fragment for Java and Ant installations.    export JAVA_HOME=&lt;some_path&gt;/jdk1.6.0_18      export ANT_HOME=&lt;some_path&gt;/apache-ant-1.7.0      export PATH=$JAVA_HOME/bin:$ANT_HOME/bin:$PATH
  </li>
  <li>
    Log out and log back in so that the system recognizes your changes.
  </li>
</ol>
<h5 id="caIntegrator1.3LocalInstallationGuide-VerifyingtheEnvironmentVariablesinLinux">
  Verifying the Environment Variables in Linux
</h5>
To verify that environment variables have been set correctly, follow these steps:
<ol>
  <li>
    From the command line, enter:  * echo $JAVA_HOME     echo $ANT_HOME    Both of these commands should return the location where you installed these tools.
  </li>
  <li>
    To verify your Ja*va SDK installation, enter   java â€“version   from a command prompt. You should see java version &#34;1.6.0_18&#34;.

More Tips
<ul>
  <li>
    Record the MySQL root username/password chosen during the MySQL installation process, as you will need to use this as your database.system.user/ database.system.password later in the UPT installation process, should you choose to install UPT.
  </li>
  <li>
    Note the MySQL port chosen during the MySQL installation process, as you will need to use this as your database.port later in both the caIntegrator and UPT (if installing UPT) installation processes.
  </li>
</ul>
<h2 id="caIntegrator1.3LocalInstallationGuide-WorkingwithPropertiesFiles">
  Working with Properties Files
</h2>
An important component of command-line installation of either caIntegrator or UPT is configuring properties files. Prior to initiating a command-line installation, property variables must be modified. Note the following points about changing or entering variables.
<h4 id="caIntegrator1.3LocalInstallationGuide-PathsinPropertiesFiles">
  Paths in Properties Files
</h4>
The paths in the *.properties files should use forward slashes. For example, you would use application.base.path=C:/apps/caIntegrator-app, not application.base.path=C:\apps\caIntegrator-app. If you use backslashes, you will experience undesirable results.
<h4 id="caIntegrator1.3LocalInstallationGuide-SpacesinPathPropertyValues">
  Spaces in Path Property Values
</h4>
You should not specify paths with spaces included as property values. In Windows, note that the C:\Documents and Settings&lt;username&gt;  path contains spaces and should not be used, or anything similar. If you are using Windows, use a path such as C:/apps/caIntegrator. Spaces are fine for property values which do not represent a path.
<h4 id="caIntegrator1.3LocalInstallationGuide-MoreAboutPropertyValues">
  More About Property Values
</h4>
In each *.properties file, any property value marked with uppercase REPLACE_* must be manually updated with the appropriate value.
<ul>
  <li>
    In each *.properties file, any property value marked with lowercase replace_* may be optionally updated with the appropriate value.
  </li>
  <li>
    If there is reference to a database.system.user for your MySQL server, you can determine which users have full privileges to create and manage other databases, by executing  show grants  from a MySQL prompt to determine the correct level of privileges.
  </li>
</ul>

  Downloading and Installing UPT (Optional)
</h2>
If you do not already have a User Provisioning Tool (UPT) installed, and you wish to manage user accounts for your caIntegrator application, you must install UPT.
<h3 id="caIntegrator1.3LocalInstallationGuide-OverviewofUPT">
  Overview of UPT
</h3>
UPT is used to provision users in the caIntegrator application. Each CBIIT application installs with its own Common Security Module (CSM) schema that has sample/default users and a role/permissions structure. To add additional users you must provision the caIntegrator application in the UPT. Then you can assign users to caIntegrator.You can download

        Use WinZip or a similar utility to unzip the files to a temporary location. This location will be referred to as the &lt;upgrade_installer directory&gt; henceforth  Example: &lt;upgrade_installer directory&gt; = C:\caintegrator2_1_2_upgrade_installer

  <li>
    Edit the default properties in the &lt;upgrade_installer_directory&gt;/upgrade.properties file. Before doing so, review

    . To do so, open both properties files, the one you configured originally when you installed the previous version of caIntegrator. (&lt;install. properties file&gt;)and the &lt;upgrade_installer_directory&gt;/upgrade.properties file.  For the latest details about configuring the properties for your updated environment, refer to the
    <a href="https://wiki.nci.nih.gov/x/MBKy" rel="nofollow">
      BDA Properties page
    </a>
    .NoteThe upgrade.properties file does not have as many attributes, so you will not need to transfer all values you set in the previous installation file.
  </li>
  <li>
    Record these property values.Modifying property valuesYou shouldn&#39;t need to modify the other default values as we have chosen unique ports to reduce the risk of other applications using the same values. However, be sure to check the *.properties file to verify that the ports in this file are not being used by other applications.
  </li>
  <li>
    From the command line, navigate to &lt;upgrade_installer_directory&gt;/ (Example:cd C:\caIntegrator_upgrade_installer), and type  ant . This initiates the upgrade process. The anticipated duration is anywhere 1-15 minutes depending on your system&#39;s speed, power and memory.  The installer upgrades your existing caIntegrator database on your MySQL server, and starts your existing JBoss server.
  </li>
  <li>
    When the installer detects that a database exists, it warns you to back it up, which you were instructed to do earlier in this process. Press Y to proceed.
  </li>
  <li>
    To verify caIntegrator installation, open your web browser to the installed instance. The URL follows this format: http://&lt;jboss.server.hostname&gt;:&lt;jboss.server.port&gt;/caintegrator /workspace.action. Example:
    <a href="http://hostname:47210/caintegrator/workspace.action" rel="nofollow">
      http://hostname:47210/caintegrator/workspace.action
    </a>
    and enter  ncimanager  as the user and  changeme  as the password. Refer to the original install.properties for the correct jboss.server.hostname and jboss.server.port values.
  </li>

  Configuring JBoss
</h3>
For Optimal PerformanceYou must modify your JBoss 4.0.5 configuration to increase the amount of available memory for the caIntegrator application. Directions for doing this in Windows are in the following step 1.To configure JBoss in Windows, follow these steps.
<ol>
  <li>
    Modify the following entry to the JBoss run.bat file which is located at &lt;application_root_directory&gt;/jboss-4.0.5.GA/bin/run.bat. Find the line that begins with set JAVA_OPTS= -Dbda=bda -Dprogram.name=%PROGNAME% -server and modify the &#34;-Xms256m -Xmx512m&#34; to read  &#34;-Xms4096m -Xmx4096m&#34; .Physical memoryIf 4096m is higher than the physical memory on the machine, then performance could be severely impacted with performance degradation and errors. 4096m of physical memory is recommended.WarningBe careful when copying and pasting from this installation guide. No spaces must come before and after the columns. A safe way to ensure that the text has no unwanted space and unwanted characters is to copy the text into a blank text editor such as NotePad first. Then you can correct the spacing and copy-paste back into the run.bat file.
  </li>
  <li>
    Restart your JBoss 4.0.5 server for the changes to take effect. The method of doing this may depend on the start/stop/restart scripts you created after the installation. Most commonly, you can execute shutdown.bat and then run.bat under $JBOSS_HOME/bin. Refer to the publicly available

  Configuring JBoss Servers and MySQL Server to Run as Services
</h4>
JBoss &amp; MySQL as servicesMySQL and the JBoss server that make up caIntegrator, and the JBoss server optionally installed for UPT, must run continually as services. The instructions in this section cover all of these scenarios. For a caIntegrator deployment, there are at least three servers, and if UPT is installed, four servers:
<ul>
  <li>
    JBoss 4.0.4 for UPT (optional)
  </li>
  <li>
    JBoss 4.0.5 (for caIntegratorapplication)
  </li>
  <li>
    MySQL 5.0.45
  </li>
</ul>

  Running JBoss as a Service
</h4>
BEFORE YOU BEGINThe default caIntegrator installation runs JBoss as a command line process using the user currently logged on. Therefore, when you log out as this user, JBoss will no longer be available for caIntegrator. For that reason, it is recommended that you configure your JBoss servers to run as a Linux or Windows service. The instructions are contained in this section.Before starting the caIntegrator JBOSS server, change the default location for user data. User data consists of various files that are saved by caIntegrator during the deployment and querying of studies. The default location for user data should be changed via the Djava.io.tmpdir jvm parameter in the Jboss run.conf file.   Example jvm parameter: -Djava.io.tmpdir=/local/content/caintegrator/jvmtmpTo run JBoss as a service, follow these steps:
