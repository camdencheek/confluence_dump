  Overview
</h2>
As an integrating/translational platform, caIntegrator depends on service-level or API interfaces for several other applications in the caBIG suite of tools. Many of these applications have ongoing development and deploy multiple releases each year. In order to better plan for potential breakage or retest necessary in caIntegrator, the team undertook an analysis of these dependencies and the planned release schedules for each. This document highlights dependencies and serves as a place to discuss any breakage to caIntegrator and to schedule this into an iteration.

  Application Dependencies
</h2>
The following applications are used by caIntegrator and require some sort of dependency management.  This table will track upcoming releases and any known changes or retest required for these releases. This work can then be scheduled into an upcoming caIntegrator iteration.

        Use caGrid data service for CQL queries and caGrid grid file transfer service.   No changes to the API for 4.5. Version 4.5 does support secure Grid services, so we will need to implement support for secure services sometime in the future.

        caGrid anaytical service for caDNAcopy used for copy number data during study deployment.  Deployed as part of Bioconductor. We are examining non-functional changes to improve performance (multi-threading) and logging.  No information on planned future releases of this tool. We do not need to adopt Bioconductor upgrades unless there are fixes to DNAcopy (which is an optional install under Bioconductor).
