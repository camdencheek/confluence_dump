4.2. On the &#39;Edit Genomic Data Source&#39; page, most of the fields are  pre-populated with default values. These include the server hostname,  which is set to array.nci.nih.gov. As it happens, this is the server  where our example array data is stored.


Every data source in caArray has a unique experiment ID that  distinguishes it from the other sources. You can enter the ID for your  experiment in the &#39;caArray Experiment Id&#39; field, which is about halfway  down the page. If you don&#39;t enter the ID for your source, then  caIntegrator won&#39;t be able to retrieve your data, and will display an  error message to that effect. In our example, the experiment ID is  &#39;jacob-00182&#39;, which we enter in the field.

If your server hostname or any of the other values for your data  source differ from the default values, then enter them into their  respective fields, then click on the &#39;Save&#39; button at the bottom of the  page. (Remember that, if your data source is private, you must enter its login  credentials into the &#39;Username&#39; and &#39;Password&#39; fields.)

Enter the values for your data source if they differ from the  default values, then click on the &#39;Save&#39; button (highlighted in red).  Don&#39;t forget to enter your caArray experiment ID â€“ the ID for our  example source is &#39;jacob-00182&#39;.
