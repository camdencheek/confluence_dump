2.9. To understand why this error is occurring, let&#39;s examine the contents of the new annotation file we just tried to load. A partial screenshot of the file appears below as viewed in a Microsoft Excel 2007 window.

Notice that this file contains not only new subjects (IDs 6000 to 6002), but also some of the same subjects (i.e., IDs 3, 5, and 10) from the previously loaded file &#34;subject_annotation_DC_Lung_Study_111210.csv&#34;. In addition, the values in the &#39;Stratagene&#39; field for these subjects are different in the new file than they were in the original file. This explains the &#39;Value Already Loaded&#39; error message which occurs when we attempt to load the file â€“ this message is another way of saying that the file we&#39;re trying to load contains duplicates of subjects from previously loaded files.We&#39;ve learned a valuable lesson from this exercise: when loading additional annotation data into an existing study, make sure that your annotation file doesn&#39;t contain any duplicates of existing subjects from previously loaded files.
