  Introduction
</h2>
<a href="https://caintegrator.nci.nih.gov/" rel="nofollow">
  caIntegrator
</a>
is a web-based software package that allows researchers to set up custom, caBIG-compatible web portals to conduct integrative research, without requiring programming experience. These portals bring together heterogeneous clinical, microarray and medical imaging data to enrich multidisciplinary research.Using caIntegrator, researchers can execute and save queries to identify and collect many types of data, combining clinical information with genetic and genomic data to enable multidimensional analysis. caintegrator uses caGrid analytical services such as GenePattern and BioConductor to perform analysis on the integrated study data, including clinical survival data.

  Known Issues/Defects
</h2>
<ol>
  <li>
    caIntegrator 1.4.1 can only pull array data from caArray v 2.5.1 and newer.
  </li>
  <li>
    CAINT-1070 Attempting to Add New Genomic Data Source in IE8 produces Restricted Area error Note: There is a workaround for this issue. After encountering the error, go to Manage Studies -&gt; Edit Study page, and re-add the Genomic Data Source. See
    <a href="https://tracker.nci.nih.gov/browse/CAINT-1070" rel="nofollow">

    There is an issue that may be seen if a user attempts to install an older version of caIntegrator after installing caIntegrator 1.4.1 using the Windows GUI installer. Older versions of caIntegrator use JBoss 4 in the installation whereas caIntegrator 1.4.1 uses JBoss 5. To avoid the issue the user must delete the .installer-caintegrator2 file before beginning the second installation. The .installer-caintegrator2 file can usually be found in a default directory such as C:\Documents and Settings\username. If this file is not removed JBoss 5 will be installed instead of JBoss 4 and the installation will fail.

    There is a known issue within the UPT that account administrators may encounter when they add new users. The UPT may erroneously indicate that the user was already created and is a duplicate. When this happens and the user is not a duplicate the new user will be create as expected and the error message can be ignored. CSM-716, New user can be created in CSM 4.2.3 successfully, but the message displayed in browser is wrong. See

    There is a known issue in caIntegrator: Uploading large clinical files and then annotating the data takes longer than expected - i.e. the screen goes blank for a long time between selections.  See
    <a href="https://tracker.nci.nih.gov/browse/CAINT-1070" rel="nofollow">
      CAINT-73

    .  This is fixed in 1.4.2 by upgrading EhCache to 2.6.6 (see

    There is known issue on that occurs intermittently on NCI&#39;s STAGE tier where the user gets an &#34;Unauthorized access&#34; during study creation (see
