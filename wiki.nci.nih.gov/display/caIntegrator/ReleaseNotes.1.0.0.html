NCICB Web PagesIntroduction ---------------------------caIntegrator2 is a web-based software package that allows researchers to set up custom, caBIG®-compatible web portals to conduct integrative research, without requiring programming experience. These portals bring together heterogeneous clinical, microarray and medical imaging data to enrich multidisciplinary research.Using caIntegrator2, researchers can execute, save and share queries to identify and collect many types of data, combining clinical information with genetic and genomic data to enable multidimensional analysis. caintegrator2 uses caGrid analytical services such as GenePattern and BioConductor to perform analysis on the integrated study data, including clinical survival data.
