  Working with Properties Files
</h2>
An important component of command-line installation of either caIntegrator or UPT is configuring properties files. Prior to initiating a command-line installation, property variables must be modified. Note the following points about changing or entering variables.
<h4 id="id-3WorkingwithcaIntegrator1.4PropertiesFiles-PathsinPropertiesFiles">
  Paths in Properties Files
</h4>
The paths in the *.properties files should use forward slashes. For example, you would use application.base.path=C:/apps/caIntegrator-app, not application.base.path=C:\apps\caIntegrator-app. If you use backslashes, you will experience undesirable results.
<h4 id="id-3WorkingwithcaIntegrator1.4PropertiesFiles-SpacesinPathPropertyValues">
  Spaces in Path Property Values
</h4>
You should not specify paths with spaces included as property values. In Windows, note that the C:\Documents and Settings{  }&lt;username&gt;  path contains spaces and should not be used, or anything similar. If you are using Windows, use a path such as C:/apps/caIntegrator. Spaces are fine for property values which do not represent a path.

In each *.properties file, any property value marked with uppercase REPLACE_* must be manually updated with the appropriate value.

    In each *.properties file, any property value marked with lowercasereplace_* may be optionally updated with the appropriate value.

    If there is reference to a database.system.user for your MySQL server, you can determine which users have full privileges to create and manage other databases, by executing  show grants  from a MySQL prompt to determine the correct level of privileges.
