.In caIntegrator, all tasks related to creating and managing user accounts can be performed only by a caIntegrator administrator using the CBIIT User Provisioning Tool (UPT) v. 4.2. The following sections discuss the use of the UPT for performing these tasks. For further information about UPT, see Chapter 3 of the
<a href="https://wiki.nci.nih.gov/x/5C0lBQ" rel="nofollow">
  CSM 5.0 Programmer&#39;s Guide
</a>
.The UPT is a separately installed application which serves as the user management interface for all National Cancer Institute CBIIT Life Sciences Distribution (LSD) applications, including caIntegrator. The UPT application is the central point for all user management functionality within caIntegrator. You can use UPT to add new users and to apply user group assignments to the caIntegrator database directly. The UPT groups can refer to predefined groups such as Study Manager or Study Investigator, which determine what roles the user has.The following terms are used both in this chapter and in the UPT to define user-related roles:
<ul>
  <li>
    User – a person who is accessing caIntegrator. The user has an associated account and user ID.
  </li>
  <li>
    User Group – a group of users, typically grouped by organization and role, for example, &#34;Columbia University Study Managers&#34;
  </li>
  <li>
    Protection Group – a group of studies given a secure status and typically grouped by organization, for example, &#34;Columbia University Protected Studies&#34;.
  </li>
</ul>

The following steps summarize the process for establishing user access to caIntegrator:

  <li>
    A potential user requests a user account in caIntegrator. See

  Creating a New caIntegrator User
</h3>
To create a new
<a href="https://wiki.nci.nih.gov/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=48726032" rel="nofollow">
  User
</a>
in caIntegrator, follow these steps:
<ol>
  <li>
    Log into UPT as a caIntegrator Admin.
  </li>
  <li>
    Search to see if the user already exists. Click the User menu option.
  </li>
  <li>
    On the User page that opens, click Select an Existing User.
  </li>
  <li>
    Use the form and search for the user. If you define no criteria, UPT returns a list of all caIntegrator users currently in the system. See the following figure for an example.
    <img alt="The example shows a list of current caIntegrator users in UPT after a user search" src="https://wiki.nci.nih.gov/download/attachments/embedded-page/caIntegrator/7%20-%20Administering%20User%20Accounts/UPT%20search%20user80.PNG?api=v2">
  </li>
  <li>
    If the user does not already exist (is not listed in the search results), then create a new user. To do so, select the User menu option again, then click Create a New User. This opens the page for creating a new caIntegrator user.
  </li>
  <li>
    Enter details only for the following required fields:
    <ul>
      <li>
        User Login Name
      </li>
      <li>
        User First Name
      </li>
      <li>
        User Last Name
      </li>
      <li>
        User PasswordCautionIf the requestor is an LDAP user, then the User Login Name must match the LDAP login ID AND the User Password field must be left blank. If the requestor is not an LDAP user, then provide a password.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    Click Add to confirm the new user.
  </li>
</ol>
At this point, you can add the new user to a
<a href="https://wiki.nci.nih.gov/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=48726032" rel="nofollow">
  user group
</a>
where you can assign roles to the user, and the user group to a
<a href="https://wiki.nci.nih.gov/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=48726032" rel="nofollow">
  protection group
</a>
where you can assign limited visiblities to the new user.It is possible for administrators to use a 3rd-party tool to create caIntegrator users and passwords, then link this system to UPT. For more information about this option, contact

<h3 id="id-7AdministeringUserAccounts-AddingaUsertoaUserGroup">
  Adding a User to a User Group
</h3>
Once you have created a new user, that user can be linked to a collection of users called a
<a href="https://wiki.nci.nih.gov/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=48726032" rel="nofollow">
  user group;
</a>
the user group would then be assigned to a
<a href="https://wiki.nci.nih.gov/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=48726032" rel="nofollow">
  protection group
</a>
.Assigning Users to Groups greatly improves the ease with which you, the admin, can provision access rights. You can instantly assign a role and protection group to an entire group of users instead of repeating the same assignment for each individual user.For example, you can assign a new user to a user group to which you have already assigned a specific role, and then assign that user group to the protection group, or you can assign a role collectively to a protection group after it is created. If a user group and/or protection group with your selected role(s) does not exist, then you can

  </li>
  <li>
    Find the user that you want to assign to a user group. Click the User menu option, then click Select an Existing User.

Now the user will have access to any studies to which the user group has been given access.User in Multiple GroupsYou can add a user to more than one user group. For example, a user could be assigned to &#34;Columbia University Study Managers&#34; as well as to &#34;Columbia University Study Investigators&#34;.

  </li>
  <li>
    Find the user group you want to assign to the the protection group.
  </li>
  <li>
    Click the Group menu option and click Select an Existing Group.
