5.6. The query results appear under the &#39;Query Results&#39; tab as a table  of subject IDs for those with available EGFR expression data. Note that  these results include subjects not only from the genomic sources that we  uploaded in this tutorial, but also from the pre-existing ones. You can  confirm this by noting that some of the subject IDs in the results  screenshot below (i.e., 10, 309) fall outside the range of IDs from the  annotation file we previously uploaded (i.e., 5000 to 5099).

You can sort these results in numerical order of subject ID by  clicking on the &#39;Subject ID&#39; heading above the right table column.

Click on the Subject ID column heading (highlighted in red) to sort the EGFR gene query results.

As it stands, these query results are not very useful, as they only  show which subjects have EGFR expression data and don&#39;t show the actual  data itself. To change this, click on the &#39;Results Type&#39; tab at the top  of the page, then click on the &#39;Gene Expression&#39; radio button under the  &#39;Select Results Type&#39; heading. This will change the query results to  display one or more numerical values which indicate the expression  levels of the EGFR gene for each sample.

Click on the &#39;Results Type&#39; tab (highlighted in red), then click on the Gene Expression button (highlighted in blue).
