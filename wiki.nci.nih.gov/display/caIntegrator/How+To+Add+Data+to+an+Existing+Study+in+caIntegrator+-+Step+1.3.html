Note that this study already has some subject annotation and genomic data loaded. The annotation data is in the form of the CSV file &#39;subject_annotation_DC_Lung_Study_111210.CSV&#39;, while the genomic data is in the form of a link to the address of the caArray server which hosts the data (array.nci.nih.gov), as well as an experiment identifier (jacob-00182) which references the particular experiment containing the data of interest. Later in this tutorial, we&#39;ll examine in depth how to load more of this data into the study.This study already has subject annotation and genomic data loaded; they are listed beneath their respective headings, which are highlighted in red. Later in this tutorial, we&#39;ll learn how to load more data into this study.
