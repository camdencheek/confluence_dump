As of v1.3.1, caIntegrator supports a new in situ oligonucleotide array platform known as Agilent Custom 2 x 415K Human CGH (Comparative Genomic Hybridization), which is an update of the stock Agilent SurePrint G3 Human CGH Microarray Kit 2x400K platform (catalog no. G4448A) adapted by The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) project.Â  For detailed technical specifications of the platform, please refer to

</a>
on the NCBI site.


This newly supported platform is similar to others in that it generates copy number results as a data type. Unlike SNP-based platforms, however, Agilent Custom 2 x 415K Human CGH does not generate LOH (Loss of Heterozygosity) or SNP (Single Nucleotide Polymorphism) data. For more information about how Agilent Custom 2 x 415K Human CGH compares to other array platforms, please refer to

on the TCGA wiki.

Please note that the platform&#39;s design file does not come bundled with the caIntegrator installer; it must be downloaded separately and manually loaded into the application by the study manager or other end user. The design file is attached to this message and can be downloaded in ADF format at the following link:

</a>
Please also note that design files download from Agilent or other sites may not work in caIntegratpr, as they may need to have their headers modified before being loaded into the application. The ADF file attached to this message has already been modified to work in caIntegrator.
