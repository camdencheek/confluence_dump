    When installing/upgrading via the GUI installer, if you enable SSL be sure to put in a password, otherwise it might fail at the end (no error message is given if there is no password at the time).  Furthermore, if you did your install using SSL, then when you upgrade and you want to keep SSL, be sure to enter a password.  If you didnt do your original install using SSL, then during upgrade you can either select SSL or not, but if you select SSL, you need to enter a password.
