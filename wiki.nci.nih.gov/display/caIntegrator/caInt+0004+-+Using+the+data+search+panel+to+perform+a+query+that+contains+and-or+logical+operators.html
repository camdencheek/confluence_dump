  Details about the Question
</h2>
I want to run a query containing both &#34;and&#34; and &#34;or&#34; operators (see an example query below). However, I could not find the selection buttons to construct such a query. Is there any way around it?



Select:
all patients who are male AND their tumor subtypes = &#34;Classical&#34;
OR
all patients who are female

In the current design, the radio buttons for logical operators are at the end of the entire query, Therefore, users can only choose either &#34;OR&#34; or &#34;AND&#34; for the whole query. A more complex query as stated in the question requires the flexibility to select the logical operator at the end of each SQL predicate. This feature was not present in the current version.

One way to get around this in current version of caIntegrator is to execute the query in multiple steps. Refer to the steps that follow.
