Following is the comment made by a user from Indiana University School of Medicine on August 04, 2010:&#34;caIntegrator has been working out very well for us. We&#39;re currently using it to store data for a neuroaids research study and we&#39;ve added data from both caArray and NBIA in addition to the main clinical data. Our main goal was to find a way to centralize all of our data so investigators would have at most one site to log in to. So far caIntegrator has been filling that role quite nicely. The new linking ability (changing URLs to clickable links) has helped out quite a bit since we have JPEG files (tissue microarray images from another application) that are associated with subject IDs.&#34;
