  Upgrading caIntegrator 1.3 to 1.4
</h3>
This section describes how to upgrade your product from caIntegrator 1.3 to caIntegrator 1.4. The directions in this section presume that you have a valid and functioning caIntegrator 1.3. It also assumes that Java SDK, Apache Ant and MySQL have all been successfully uploaded and installed, as described on pages
<a href="https://wiki.nci.nih.gov/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=91796442" rel="nofollow">
  Required Software Not Included in caIntegrator

 .You can perform an upgrade installation of caIntegrator v.1.3 using either of these two methods:
<ul>
  <li>
    A GUI Installation wizard. Instructions for this method are found in

  </li>
</ul>
BEFORE YOU BEGIN
<ul>
  <li>
    Important: Backup the 1.3 database. You need to create a reliable copy of your entire caIntegrator database.
  </li>
  <li>
    Important: Backup the current installation of caIntegrator and artifacts from the original installation, such as properties files.
  </li>

.To perform an upgrade to caIntegrator 1.4 using the GUI Installation Wizard, follow these steps:
<ol>
  <li>
    Because of the upgrade from JBOSS4 to JBOSS5 in the caIntegrator 1.4 release, two GUI installer invocations are required. The first will install the new JBOSS5 in the same directory as the existing JBOSS4 and the second will update the database.
  </li>
  <li>
    Open the install.properties file for the existing 1.3 installation located at &lt;user home&gt;/.installer-caintegrator/caintegrator_installer/install.properties and save it as install.properties_v1.3 to your desktop for reference during the upgrade.
  </li>
  <li>
    Open a command prompt in the directory where you downloaded the caintegrator2_gui_distribution_1.4.jar-201207171753.jar and invoke the GUI installer using this: java --jar caintegrator2_gui_distribution_1.4.jar-201207171753.jar.
  </li>
  <li>
    The Installation Wizard opens to facilitate the installation process. Click Next to proceed through the pages of the wizard, beginning with progressing past the Welcome page.
  </li>
  <li>
    Review the release notes.
  </li>
  <li>
    You must accept the license agreement to continue.
  </li>

    Select JBoss in step #6.
  </li>
  <li>
    Configure the JBoss Server-related settings.
  </li>
  <li>
    Specify the authentication type that caIntegrator is using. If you choose LDAP, configure the LDAP information: the LDAP Host Name, the LDAP Search Base, and the LDAP Search Prefix. An example of the Host Name is  ldaps://myldaphost.mydomain.com:636 .
  </li>
  <li>
    Review the summary of gathered information.
  </li>
  <li>
    Click Next to proceed through the next two pages.

  Upgrading caIntegrator to v. 1.4 Using the Command-Line Installer
</h4>
To perform an upgrade to caIntegrator 1.4 using the command-line, follow these steps:
<ol>
  <li>
    Because of the upgrade from JBOSS4 to JBOSS5 in the caIntegrator 1.4 release, two ant commands are required. The first will install the new JBOSS5 in the same directory as the existing JBOSS4 and the second will update the database.
  </li>
  <li>
    Open the install.properties file found in the application.base.path directory and save it to your desktop as install.properties.v1.3.1 for reference during the upgrade.
  </li>
  <li>
    Delete the caintegrator2-install-1.3.1.zip file from its directory such as the application.base.path directory.
  </li>
  <li>
    Download caintegrator2-install-1.4.zip to the directory where the previous install zip file was such as the application.base.path directory. From the directory where you downloaded the install zip file, extract the files, using one of these two methods:
    <ol>
      <li>
        Open a command prompt and use it to extract this file. For example, you may enter a command such as   unzip -q caintegrator2-install-1.4.zip  . You must have a ZIP tool installed.
      </li>
      <li>
        Use WinZip or a similar utility to unzip the files.
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>
    When asked if you would like to replace the existing files, respond All.
  </li>
  <li>
    Open the install.properties file and replace all REPLACE_VALUE properties with the values in the install.properties.v1.3.1 file. Before doing so, review

    .
  </li>
  <li>
    In the DATABASE SETTINGS section of the install.properties file replace database.re-create=true with database.re-create=false. In the DATABASE SETTINGS section of the install.properties file add the property and value exclude.database=true.
  </li>
  <li>
    Save this file to your desktop as install.properties.v1.4step1. Save this file to your desktop a second time, this time as install.properties. Upload the install.properties file to the application.base.path directory.Modifying property valuesYou shouldn&#39;t need to modify the other default values as we have chosen unique ports to reduce the risk of other applications using the same values. However, be sure to check the *.properties file to verify that the ports in this file are not being used by other applications.
  </li>
  <li>
    From the command line, navigate to the directory where you unzipped the installer file and type  ant . This is the first of two ant commands. The anticipated duration is anywhere 1-15 minutes depending on your system&#39;s speed, power and memory.
  </li>
  <li>
    When the installer detects that a database exists, it warns you to back it up, which you were instructed to do earlier in this process. Press Y to proceed.
  </li>
  <li>
    If you open the application now in a browser window you will see a MYSQLGrammerException error.
  </li>
  <li>
    Stop the server.
  </li>
  <li>
    Open the install.properties file and revert database.re-create=false back to database.re-create=true. Delete the property and value exclude.database=true.
  </li>
  <li>
    Save this file to your desktop as install.properties.v1.4step2. Save this file to your desktop a second time, this time as install.properties. Upload the install.properties file to the application.base.path directory.
