While the &#39;Edit Sample Mappings&#39; page lists all the samples from your  source (both mapped and unmapped), it doesn&#39;t indicate which of these  samples came from cases and which came from controls.

Since this information may be considered important to your study, we  need a way of distinguishing between the cases and controls. The way  that caIntegrator addresses this need is with a &#39;control training file&#39;  that lists the sample IDs of all the controls. Any sample that is not listed in this file comes from a case. The screenshot below shows a  portion of an example training file in CSV format from a Microsoft Excel  2007 window.

A portion of a control training file listing the sample IDs of all  the controls from our example data source. You don&#39;t need to understand  the format or nomenclature of the sample IDs â€“ they were generated by  the instrument or technician who ran the samples.
