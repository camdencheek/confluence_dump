  Introduction
</h2>
<a href="https://caintegrator.nci.nih.gov/" rel="nofollow">
  caIntegrator
</a>
is a web-based software package that allows researchers to set up custom, caBIG-compatible web portals to conduct integrative research, without requiring programming experience. These portals bring together heterogeneous clinical, microarray and medical imaging data to enrich multidisciplinary research.Using caIntegrator, researchers can execute and save queries to identify and collect many types of data, combining clinical information with genetic and genomic data to enable multidimensional analysis. caintegrator uses caGrid analytical services such as GenePattern and BioConductor to perform analysis on the integrated study data, including clinical survival data.

  Highlights of caIntegrator v1.4
</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    Automatic refresh of data between caIntegrator and caArray: For an existing study in caIntegrator, an option will be added to check for automatic data updates from caArray. The Study Manager will see a notification that there is new data available for deployment. The Study Manger will be given an option to use the new data and redeploy the study or to do nothing and keep the study as it is.
  </li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>
    Strong role based security in caIntegrator: Study Manager should be able to assign multiple levels of security for users based on their roles in conjunction with the data privacy rules. Study manager also should be able to assign row level and column level security to uploaded data.
  </li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>
    Single Sign-on: Users should be able to log in to one application (caArray or caIntegrator) and navigate to the other application without having to log in again. This feature should be enabled at the deployment time for both applications.
  </li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>
    Better version control: A study manager should be able to create a new study similar to an existing study relatively easy. A study manager user should be able to indicate an existing study as archived as well.
  </li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>
    Major technology upgrades: Jboss 5.1, Java 6, caGrid v1.5, Struts 2.3.1.5, and NCI build-and-deploy infrastructure (NCI Nexus repository, AntHill Pro 3, BDALite).
  </li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>
    Section 508 compliance improvements.
  </li>

    caIntegrator v 1.4 can only pull array data from caArray v 2.5.1 and newer.

    There is an issue that may be seen if a user attempts to install an older version of caIntegrator after installing caIntegrator 1.4 using the Windows GUI installer. Older versions of caIntegrator use JBOSS4 in the installation whereas caIntegrator 1.4 uses JBOSS5. To avoid the issue the user must delete the .installer-caintegrator2 file before beginning the second installation. The .installer-caintegrator2 file can usually be found in a default directory such as C:\Documents and Settings\username. If this file is not removed JBOSS5 will be installed instead of JBOSS4 and the installation will fail.

    There is a known issue within the UPT that account administrators may encounter when they add new users. The UPT may erroneously indicate that the user was already created and is a duplicate. When this happens and the user is not a duplicate the new user will be create as expected and the error message can be ignored. CSM-716, New user can be created in CSM 4.2.3 successfully, but the message displayed in browser is wrong. See
