An ISA archive is a compressed (.zip) file containing multiple text files and data files. Each tab-delimited text file in an ISA archive describes the structure, meaning the column headers and row values when considered in spreadsheet format, of the investigation, study, and assay components of the archive. The data files correspond to each assay and are included in the archive in their native format, for example, Microsoft Excel. An ISA archive may also contain images and other files.Uploading investigation data requires a logged-in CSSI DCC user account with permission to upload.
