If you have requested open access for an investigation, and if your request had an incorrect embargo date, you can change the embargo date after an administrator has approved the open access request. You can also remove the embargo date, which means you want the system to make the investigation open access immediately when the administrator approves it again.

    Wait until an administrator has approved the open access request. On the Upload ISA Archives page, the system changes the status of the investigation version to Open Access approved, Embargoed.
