provides additional technical information about validating ISA archives.If your ISA archive does not meet those standards and conventions, you may encounter an error when you upload it to the CSSI DCC Portal. Your ISA archive will likely process successfully but the application will detail the error in the Status column. You may then want to address the error and upload again. A sample error message follows:Missing Data Files: File processed successfully. 1 files referenced in the assay(s) were not found. Click here to view the missing file lists (limited to 1000 entries each).CSSI DCC looks for errors in three types of files that are commonly in an ISA archive:
<ul>
  <li>
    Data files: If there are more than 1000 missing data files for an assay file, only the first 1000 will be listed.
  </li>
  <li>
    Additional files: If files are found in your uploaded archive, but were not referenced in the metadata, they are listed.
  </li>
  <li>
    External file references: The upload summary lists all of the external file references in your uploaded archive and notes whether or not they are verified.
  </li>
</ul>
After the upload completes, the error message appears in the Status column of the File Upload area on the Upload Single ISA Archive tab. It provides an overview of the error and a link to the details.

 Click the link in the status message. A page opens that details the status of the three types of files in the uploaded ISA archive.The Missing Files section details each missing data file referenced in the metadata of the assays:

The Additional Files sections details files you uploaded that you didn&#39;t reference in the archive&#39;s metadata.

The External File References section lists external file references in your uploaded archive and notes whether they are verified or not.

If the portal can detect that the URL is valid without authenticating it, it appears in this list as “Verified.”In all other cases, it appears as “Not Verified.”File size is not tallied for external file references.
