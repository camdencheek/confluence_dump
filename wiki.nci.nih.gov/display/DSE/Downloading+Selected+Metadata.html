    On the Investigation Details page, click Download Selected Metadata.Your browser prompts you to open or save the ZIP file. Follow your browser&#39;s instructions to open or save the file.Archive File ContentsThe archive file is in compressed format. When you download it, the system generates a single compressed folder (a ZIP file). When you open it, you see at minimum three text files at the root of the folder or file. An example of these follow.    a_10290.txt   i_10290.txt   s_10290.txtThe text files contain metadata to describe the investigation, study or studies, and assay or assays. In this example, 10290 represents the file identifier but in practice, each file identifier may be named differently, even in the same investigation. Only the a, i, or s prefix is required. Keep in mind these files when performing a download:
    <ul>
      <li>
        If you download metadata, the archive only includes the a, i, and s files (the metadata files).
      </li>
      <li>
        If you download full data, the archive does not contain the metadata files, but does contain data files or folders as appropriate for the investigation; for example, images.
      </li>
      <li>
        If you perform a partial download, the archive includes the metadata and data files for your selections.
