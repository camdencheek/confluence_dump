When uploading an ISA archive to a CSSI DCC folder, you can specify who can access its investigation data. You can do this before or after you request open access for your data. You can control access to the entire investigation or only selected assays and studies.You must have the role of uploader or higher to control data access. Your administrator determines your role.When you assign access, you assign it to one or more groups rather than individual users, though a single group could contain a single user. Anyone with upload privileges can create and manage these groups, but you must create the group(s) before you upload.The following page familyÂ describes how to control access to investigation data.
