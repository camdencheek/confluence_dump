When you download data from CSSI DCC, keep in mind the following points:
<ul>
  <li>
    Each time you download data while logged in, the system archives that download.
  </li>
  <li>
    You can view a list of your previous downloads.
  </li>
  <li>
    Partial or filtered downloads expire in seven days. Full downloads never expire.
    <ul>
      <li>
        A full download is an unfiltered download of an entire investigation.
      </li>
      <li>
        A filtered download is one created by selecting metadata in the Visualize and Select section of the investigation, study, or assay details page. For instructions, refer to
        <a href="https://wiki.nci.nih.gov/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=413762371" rel="nofollow">
          Visualizing and Filtering Data
        </a>
        .
      </li>
      <li>
        A partial download is a filtered download, or a download at the study or assay level.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    If an archived download has not expired, you can download it again. If a download has expired, you can download it only one more time.
  </li>
  <li>
    If something interrupts your download, you can resume the download.
  </li>
  <li>
    The system constructs download zip filenames with the following components:
    <ul>
      <li>
        Investigation ID (for example, 123456789a123456789b1234)
      </li>
      <li>
        Investigation title
      </li>
      <li>
        &#34;Full&#34; or &#34;Partial&#34;
      </li>
      <li>
        &#34;data&#34; if the zip file contains only data
      </li>
      <li>
        &#34;metadata&#34; if the zip file contains only metadata
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    When constructing the zip filename, the system omits spaces and special characters from the investigation title. If the resulting investigation title is more than 40 characters, the system truncates the title part of the filename as follows:
    <ul>
      <li>
        The first 19 characters
      </li>
      <li>
        Two underscores
      </li>
      <li>
        The last 19 characters
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    Example download filenames include:
    <ul>
      <li>
        123456789a123456789b1234_ExampleInvestigationTitle_Full_data.zip
      </li>
      <li>
        123456789a123456789b1234_ExampleInvestigationTitle_Full_metadata.zip
      </li>
      <li>
        123456789a123456789b1234_ExampleInvestigationTitle_Partial.zip
      </li>
      <li>
        123456789a123456789b1234_ExampleInvestigationTitle_Partial_metadata.zip
      </li>
