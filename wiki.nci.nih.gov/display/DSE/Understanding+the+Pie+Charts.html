When you first open the Browse Investigation page or reset it to clear all selections, three pie charts appear at the top. These pie charts represent three of the fields that occur in the metadata of the investigations currently in the portal:
<ul>
  <li>
    Study Protocol Name
  </li>
  <li>
    Study Assay Technology Type
  </li>
  <li>
    Study Assay Measurement Type
  </li>
</ul>
The values for those fields, as well as a count for each value, appear in the pie charts. The count represents the number of times that field value occurs in all of the investigations currently in the portal. (Click the following image to expand it.)

For example, the default pie charts represented in the above screenshot show the following information:
<ul>
  <li>
    The Study Protocol Name pie chart shows that four investigations used a blood draw protocol.
  </li>
  <li>
    The Study Assay Technology Type pie chart shows that two investigations used light microscopy.
  </li>
</ul>
The sum of numbers in each pie chart can exceed the total number of investigations in the system, because each investigation can have more than one value in each pie chart. You can determine the values for each investigation by clicking on each pie slice and reviewing the details in the list below the charts.Click one or more field values in the pie charts (&#34;slices&#34;) to filter the data by that/those field value(s). The more field values you select, in one or more pie charts, the more narrowly you filter the investigation data and the fewer investigations match your selections. The investigation list refreshes each time you filter the data in this way. You can also customize which fields appear in the pie charts and how many pie charts appear by adding and removing fields. (For instructions, refer to

  Adding and Removing Fields
</a>
.)In the following screenshot, a user has selected at least one field value in each pie chart. The selected values are:
<ul>
  <li>
    Scanning in the Study Protocol Name chart
  </li>
  <li>
    CNV analysis in the Study Assay Measurement Type chart
  </li>
  <li>
    Next Generation Sequencing in the Study Assay Technology Type chart
  </li>
</ul>
Only one investigation matches all of these selections and appears in the list below the charts. To reduce the amount of filtering, you can take one of the following actions:
<ul>
  <li>
    To reset an individual pie chart, click reset on that chart.
  </li>
  <li>
    To reset all pie charts to their defaults, you can take one the following actions:
    <ul>
      <li>
        Click Reset All.
      </li>
      <li>
        Select Investigations &gt; Browse.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
