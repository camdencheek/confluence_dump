When you create a folder (as described in
<a href="https://wiki.nci.nih.gov/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=397286166" rel="nofollow">
  Uploading ISA Archives
</a>
), you are automatically the owner of that folder. You can add additional owners as needed. All owners must be registered CSSI-DCC users with the uploader role. Note that it is a best practice to have only one folder owner; if you share ownership, the other owner could accidentally delete you.

    Log in to the CSSI DCC Portal, as described in

  <li>
    Select Investigations &gt; Upload. The Upload ISA Archives page appears.

    For the folder of interest, click Owners. The Project Owners dialog box appears. (The terms folder and project are synonyms.)

  </li>
  <li>
    Enter the email address of the person you want to add as an owner of the folder.Make sure the email address you enter is correct. The CSSI DCC Portal informs you if the email address is not a registered CSSI DCC user. However, if the email address is a registered user but not the intended recipient&#39;s correct address, the wrong person may receive an email notification.
  </li>
  <li>
    Click Add co-owner. The new owner&#39;s login ID appears in the Project Owners dialog box. The system sends to each owner of the folder, and to the email address you specified, an email notification with &#34;CSSI DCC Portal: project owner added&#34; as the subject line.
  </li>
</ol>
If the CSSI DCC Portal does not already have a user account for the specified email address, the system prompts the new user to log in and visit the My Account page to request the ability to upload investigation data. For more information, refer to
