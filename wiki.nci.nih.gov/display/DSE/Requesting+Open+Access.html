    <ul>
      <li>
        The value of the Open Access Version field equals the number of the version that is currently open to the public.
      </li>
      <li>
        The Open Access Status field should be Current Version, Open Access approved on &lt;date and timestamp&gt;.
      </li>
    </ul>
    If another version of this investigation had been made open access previously, the system automatically removes it from open access.
