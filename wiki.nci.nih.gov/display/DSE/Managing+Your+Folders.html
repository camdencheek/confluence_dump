When you create a folder (as described in
<a href="https://wiki.nci.nih.gov/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=397286166" rel="nofollow">
  Uploading ISA Archives
</a>
), you are automatically the owner of that folder. You can add additional owners as needed. All owners must be registered CSSI-DCC users with the uploader role. It is a best practice to have only one folder owner; if you share ownership, the other owner could accidentally delete you.Each owner of a folder can perform the following tasks:
<ul>
  <li>
    Upload an additional investigation version to that folder
  </li>
  <li>
    Rename an investigation folder
  </li>
  <li>
    For each study or assay in an investigation version, either give all users access or restrict access to one or more groups
  </li>
  <li>
    Preview an investigation version
  </li>
  <li>
    Request open access for an investigation version
  </li>
  <li>
    View or edit the metadata of an investigation version
  </li>
  <li>
    Add an owner to the folder or remove an owner from it
  </li>
</ul>
