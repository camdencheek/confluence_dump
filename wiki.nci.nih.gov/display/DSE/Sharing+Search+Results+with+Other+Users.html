You can share with other users a series of investigations in the CSSI DCC Portal. For example, if you want to share all investigations that mention the keyword CTC, share the following URL:
<a href="https://cssi-dcc.nci.nih.gov/cssiportal/search/?q=CTC" rel="nofollow">
  https://cssi-dcc.nci.nih.gov/cssiportal/search/?q=CTC
</a>
 If you click the above link, the Search Investigations page appears with CTC in the Search box and with results of that search. Keep in mind the following points:
<ul>
  <li>
    Make sure the q in the URL is lowercase.
  </li>
  <li>
    If your search term is multiple words, replace each space with %20 as in the following example:
    <a href="https://cssi-dcc.nci.nih.gov/cssiportal/search/?q=Circulating%20Tumor%20Cell" rel="nofollow">
      https://cssi-dcc.nci.nih.gov/cssiportal/search/?q=Circulating%20Tumor%20Cell
    </a>
  </li>
  <li>
    If your user account has a default saved search, a search term in the URL (?q=&lt;value&gt; as in the above example) overrides the default search.
  </li>
  <li>
    If you use an asterisk (*) as the search term, or if you omit the search term entirely, the Search Investigations page lists all results:
    <ul>
      <li>
        Example with an asterisk:
        <a href="https://cssi-dcc.nci.nih.gov/cssiportal/search/?q=*" rel="nofollow">
          https://cssi-dcc.nci.nih.gov/cssiportal/search/?q=*
        </a>
      </li>
      <li>
        Example that omits the search term:
        <a href="https://cssi-dcc.nci.nih.gov/cssiportal/search/?q=" rel="nofollow">
          https://cssi-dcc.nci.nih.gov/cssiportal/search/?q=
        </a>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    If you use the Search box as described in
    <a href="https://wiki.nci.nih.gov/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=373002826" rel="nofollow">
      Performing a Basic Search
    </a>
    , this search overrides any search terms in the browser address bar.
  </li>
  <li>
    If you visit another page, the system displays the URL of the new page, effectively clearing the search from the URL.
  </li>
</ul>
