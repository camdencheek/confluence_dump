    Click Add User. The Add a User to the Group page appears.

  </li>
  <li>
    Enter the email address of the person you want to add to the group.Make sure the email address you enter is correct. The CSSI DCC Portal informs you if you make a syntax error in the email address. However, if the email address is syntactically correct but not the intended recipient&#39;s correct address, the wrong person may receive an email notification.
  </li>
  <li>
    Select a role for the person, either Owner or Member. If you created the group, you are automatically an owner. Note that it is a best practice to have only one owner in a group; if you share ownership, the other owner could accidentally delete you.
  </li>
  <li>
    Click Submit. The response from the system depends on whether the CSSI DCC Portal already has a user account for that email address (in another group):
    <ul>
      <li>
        If so, the system sends the following email notifications:
        <ul>
          <li>
            To each owner of the group, an email notification with &#34;CSSI DCC User Granted Access to your Group&#34; as the subject line.
          </li>
          <li>
            To the email address you specified, an email notification with &#34;You have been added to a CSSI DCC group&#34; as the subject line.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        Otherwise, the system sends the following email notifications:
        <ul>
          <li>
            To each owner of the group, email notifications with &#34;New CSSI DCC User Created for your Group&#34; and &#34;CSSI DCC User Granted Access to your Group&#34; as the subject lines.
          </li>
          <li>
            To the email address you specified, an email notification with &#34;You have been added to a CSSI DCC group&#34; as the subject line.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
