You can search all investigations, studies, and assays in the CSSI DCC Portal by field-specific keyword or phrase. You can select one or more ISA tab fields, and then apply a search term to each specific field.A field-specific search typically reduces the number of search results. For example, consider a system that has two investigations with &#39;tumor&#39; mentioned only in the Investigation Title field, and two investigations with &#39;tumor&#39; mentioned only in the Investigation Description field. In this example, if you search for &#39;tumor&#39; as a basic search, the system lists four investigations. However, if you search for &#39;tumor&#39; within the Investigation Title only, the system lists only two investigations.To search ISA Tab fields
