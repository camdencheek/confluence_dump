        Dev:
        <ol>
          <li>
            Focused on new classifier this week. Some core things can be reused but most of the old classifier cannot.  Should fit with existing protégé as a plugin
          </li>
          <li>
            Little bit of time on new bug due to new curator functionality. Nick found it and Bob has already fixed it, but waiting to see if any other issue arise. Will require a new protégé client, can’t be fixed by plugin

        QA:
        <ol>
          <li>
            Done with release. Trying to fix existing automation scripts
          </li>
          <li>
            Has some tests that he needs to start automation
          </li>
          <li>
            Question: automation of complex properties encountered issues due to changes. Is there a list of changes so he can predictably update his automated tests. Bob said the preferred name/code swap should be the only gui change made
          </li>
          <li>
            Will touch back next Monday

        <ol>
          <li>
            Production went in on Monday.
          </li>
          <li>
            Configuration .fileprefs caused some issues.  Some editors have been reporting problems throughout the week.  All advised to delete .fileprefs
          </li>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Deleting fileprefs will default to entities tab.
            </li>
            <li>
              The issue is due to the connection to the server saving properties to the .fileprefs.  Some lower tiers have properties different than prod
            </li>
            <li>
              I need to set up a new client pointed at prod and repackage for users.
            </li>
            <li>
              Need to look at harmonizing properties on the lower tiers.
            </li>
            <li>
              Per Bob, preferences were consolidated to one file while old protégé separated them out, with specific files for different OS. Maybe we need to re-examine that
            </li>
          </ul>
          <li>
            Update run.bat to 12g

        Gilberto:
        <ul>
          <li>
            Classification quick look. Looking at memory settings for classification. Has an excel spreadsheet comparing different memory values for classification.  Says classification can be either fast or slow with no intermediates. Seems to rely on how long extraction thread takes to engage.
          </li>
          <li>
            Bob says it depends on the features you use in your modeling. Thinks it is CPU starvation rather than contention. Possibly putting them in serial will help?
          </li>
          <li>
            Gilberto suggested extraction could run in the background when protégé starts, rather than waiting on classification to be requested.
          </li>
          <li>
            Bob said he would think about it and determine how complex it would be.
          </li>
          <li>
            Gilberto said editors are not using interim classifier anyway, so maybe could disable it.
