    Transfer a copy of the Protégé Client folder from the server to your local machine, or utilize the folder from your local machine if the build was performed locally.

    Create a zip file of the folder, as well as a self-extractor of the folder. To create the self-extractor, right click on the newly created zip file, and select &#34;Winzip, then Create Self-Extractor (.exe). Once the self-extractor window appears, set the default &#34;unzip to folder&#34; path to &#34;C:/Program Files&#34;. Another window will appear requesting if the user would like to test if the self-extractor will unzip the contents into the specified path. Agree and check that it unpacks correctly to C:/Program Files/Protégé.Client-x.x.x
