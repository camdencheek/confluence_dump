  Protégé Searching on Property, Role and Association Codes
</h1>
It can be difficult getting a list of the NCIt or BiomedGT properties in the Properties tab. Protege and OWL specific properties are intermixed with the locally defined properties. You can search for these properties by searching in the Lucene Query Tab. By convention the code for all properties begins with &#34;P&#34;, the code for roles begins with &#34;R&#34; and the code for associations begins with &#34;A&#34;.

Do a search on &#34;code&#34; using &#34;begins with&#34; and the letter &#34;P&#34; to pull properties.
