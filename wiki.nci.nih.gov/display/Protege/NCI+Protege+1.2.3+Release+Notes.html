  2.0 New Features and Updates
</h2>
This release contains 3 new features - (1) Run time classification; (2) Advanced Query Plugin reporting capability; (3) additional configurability
<h3 id="NCIProtege1.2.3ReleaseNotes-RunTimeClassification">
  Run Time Classification
</h3>
This new functionality allows editors to classify BiomedGT, or NCIT, in the Protege client-server environment used by the EVS. It depends on an explanation server running independently of the Protege server.  The explanation server is initialized with the same data served by the Protege server, and is maintained synchronized with the database as editing occurs by the Protege client. Because of initialization activities, the first classification action by a client will take a number of minutes; subsequent classifications will be faster.

Salient points:
<ul>
  <li>
    Enhanced detection of exceptional conditions allowing better error handling and explanation services
  </li>
  <li>
    Parallel improvements on the Explanation Tab GUI to make explanations easier to interpret
  </li>
  <li>
    Performance increase due to improved memory management and optimizations in the classification and extraction algorithms
  </li>
</ul>
Known issues:
<ul>
  <li>
    A side effect of the requirement for synchronization with the explanation server is that batch loads and edits can take longer and throw exceptions.  Batch loads and edits need to be conducted under controlled conditions:  the recommendation is for the workflow manager to conduct these batch actions in standalone database mode and with the explanation server shut down.
  </li>
  <li>
    Limited concurrency.  On a classification action by the RTC, there will be a period of time in which the DB is locked for writing.  The suggested workaround is for one editor, perhaps the workflow manager, to conduct the classification action and advertise to the editors to cease editing while classification is ongoing.  This would still allow browsing of the database by other editors.
  </li>
  <li>
    High network communications overhead.  The classification time will be significantly increased on classifications by remote editors.
  </li>
</ul>
The last two issues will be addressed in a future patch.  However, a &#34;remote access&#34; server is being set up that will alleviate communications overhead.
<h3 id="NCIProtege1.2.3ReleaseNotes-ReportingfunctionalityaddedtotheAdvancedQueryPlugin">
  Reporting functionality added to the Advanced Query Plugin
</h3>
An export function (leveraged from an existing plugin in Protege) has been added to the AQP which allows very detailed reports to be produced in a tabular format. This function doesn&#39;t replace the Report Writer.
<h3 id="NCIProtege1.2.3ReleaseNotes-IncreasedConfigurability">
  Increased Configurability
</h3>
Although written to support editing activities in the EVS, the NCIEditTab plugin has introduced various user interfaces and behaviors that make it an attractive plugin to other editing groups.  Hence configurability has been a background refactoring activity as development progressed.  This is noted here because with the EVS now editing BiomedGT and NCIT, this aspect becomes very important as the internal format of annotations in BGT is expected to start deviating significantly from NCIT&#39;s in the near future.  Some features related to display labels remain to be implemented.

Salient points:
<ul>
  <li>
    Specifies what properties are qualified and hence need to be edited in one of the complex panels of the NCIEditTab, where qualified properties are properties with multiple xml-delimited subfields as their value.
  </li>
  <li>
    Maps xml elements of qualified annotation properties to fields in editing panels.
  </li>
  <li>
    Specifies properties and concepts required by the business logic of the various functions in the NCIEditTab (e.g. properties supporting retirement actions).
  </li>
  <li>
    Specifies external sources requiring restricted editing privileges.
  </li>
  <li>
    Specifies external Semantic Media Wiki servers supporting collaborative development
  </li>
</ul>
<h2 id="NCIProtege1.2.3ReleaseNotes-3.0EnhancementsandBugFixesSinceLastRelease">
  3.0 Enhancements and Bug Fixes Since Last Release
</h2>
NoteThe addition of copy-and-paste to the collaborative panel, GUI and behavior enhancements to the workflow plugin, increased support for semantic types.

    Re: GForge #14533 - Batch load in client server mode -- Please give batch loads of over 200 concepts to workflow manager to load in standalone mode -- known issues with large batch loads in client server mode. The loads are quick, about 10 minutes for 250.
  </li>
  <li>
    Special Review User needs to be created for NCI Thesaurus, and config file modified to give this user privilege to edit those definitions. (Batch load may still work for loading these definitions.)
  </li>
  <li>
    Export from AQP -- When exporting concepts that contain properties that have values that contain commas (such as definition) the data will display incorrectly.
  </li>
  <li>
    Exporting from AQP -- HINT - When you export to Excel, if you are using the new Excel 7.0, you need to import the file first.
  </li>
  <li>
    Export from AQP -- HINT - When you export to Excel, if you don&#39;t like the file and want to make a change, get out of Excel before creating a new export, or save the new file with a different name because Excel will lock the file.
  </li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>
    GForge #14507- Prompt reports all concepts changed - concepts get new properties added
