  Tool Overview
</h2>
 NCI Protégé is a collection of Protégé plug-ins developed for the NCI-specific editing environment. Protégé is an open-source development environment for ontologies and knowledge based systems. The OWL plug-in extends the environment to support the Web Ontology Language (OWL). Refer to the

page for more information.NCI Protégé is a collection of Protégé plug-ins used to edit the NCI Thesaurus. NCI Protégé provides a customized OWL editing environment, including additional editing and querying capabilities that are not available in the Protégé OWL plug-in. The NCI-specific plug-ins have been implemented as a tabbed interface. Beginning with NCI Protégé 1.3.0. this tool allows imports of ontologies in database mode and enables collaborators to begin &#34;federating&#34; ontologies.NCI Protégé runs in a client-server environment. Current editors will want to download the client only. Others may wish to download for review or download and install the entire client-server package. Links to both are provided in the

<ul>
  <li>
    The installation folders for the client, Explanation server and Protégé server.

  <li>
    A metaproject which contains accounts for editor and administrator by default.

The final version of NCI Protégé (1.4.3) to be built on the Protégé 3.4 code base from Stanford has been released. The status of NCI Protégé is now maintenance mode. Only major bugs that appear in production will be fixed. Future versions of NCI Protégé are being considered for the Protege 4 code base.
<h3 id="NCIProtege-Features">
  Features
</h3>
The EVS Protégé distribution includes the NCIEditTab Protégé plug-in editing client (and other plug-ins), a highly concurrent Protégé server (modified from the base Stanford distribution), and an Explanation server that includes the Pellet reasoner.
<h3 id="NCIProtege-ClientEnvironment">
  Client Environment
</h3>
The client environment includes:
<ul>
  <li>
    NCIEditTab plug-in, supporting basic editing functionality as well as complex edits (merge, split, retirement, and cloning), batch jobs, report writing, and tree-like views of graphs built along transitive relationships (e.g. part_of). It supports XMLLiterals for complex properties as per configuration, and tracks editing history independently of the change ontology, which is used in support of Prompt.
  </li>
  <li>
    LuceneQuery tab plug-in, supporting a variety of search modes (including negation) on annotations and restrictions as well as indexed Lucene &#34;match&#34; and &#34;sounds like&#34; searching, plus reporting support for the result sets.
  </li>
  <li>
    Explanation tab plug-in, providing a description logic entailment-explanation facility integrated with an incremental classifier; classification results are available to all the clients in the client-server environment.
  </li>
  <li>
    Workflow tab plug-in, supporting basic workflow/assignment functionality, and communications to Semantic Media Wiki if set up for collaborative development.
  </li>
</ul>
