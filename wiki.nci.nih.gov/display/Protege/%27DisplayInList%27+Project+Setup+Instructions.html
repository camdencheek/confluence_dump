Instructions follow for Configuring DisplayInList SettingInstructions should only be a one-time procedure per metaproject if the DisplayInList property has not already been set.
<ul>
  <li>
    On the class hierarchy section in the metaproject, click on &#39;Operation&#39;, then &#39;CoreProtegeOperations&#39; underneath. Within the Instance Browser section, select the &#39;Create New Instance&#39; button, and add &#39;DisplayInList&#39; as the new operation name.
  </li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>
    On the left-hand menu, click on &#39;GroupOperation&#39;, and select &#39;GrpOp(World).&#39; You will then see a list of allowed operations for the group on the right.  Click &#39;Add a new Instance&#39;, and select &#39;DisplayInList&#39; to be added.
  </li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>
    On the left-hand menu, select &#39;PolicyControlledObject&#39;, and click &#39;Project&#39;. Select a project in the Instance Browser section, and add the GrpOp(World) group operation in the lower section of the Instance Editor. Do the same for all projects.
  </li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>
    On the left-hand side menu, select &#39;Group&#39; and select &#39;World&#39; from the Instance Browser section. Within the Instance Editor section add all users in the metaproject to the World Group. Save changes and exit the client.
  </li>
</ul>
If &#39;DisplayInList&#39; exists in &#39;GrpOp(World)&#39; yet you need to hide a certain project from selection (e.g., the Annotation Thesaurus), clone the GrpOp(World) instance and remove the &#39;DisplayInList&#39; instance.  You will then need to assign the correct &#39;GrpOp(World)&#39; instance to that particular Project instance.  The selection order should match those that were in the instance pane.
