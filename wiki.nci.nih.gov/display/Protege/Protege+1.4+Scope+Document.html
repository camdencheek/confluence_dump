The purpose of this document is to collect, analyze, and define high-level needs and features of the National Cancer Institute Center for Biomedical Informatics and Information Technology (NCI CBIIT) Protégé Release 1.4. This document focuses on the functionalities proposed by the product stakeholders and target users in order to make it a better product. The use-case and supplementary specifications document will detail how the framework will fulfill these needs.
<h2 id="Protege1.4ScopeDocument-VisionandNeeds">
  Vision and Needs
</h2>
The objective of this release of Protégé 1.4 is to harden Protege so the project can go into an operation and maintenance mode of operation in lieu of actively developing new releases of the product containing new features.  Protege 1.4 is planned to be the last major release of Protégé.This release will be performed over five iterations:Iteration B0 - will focus on merging the 1.3 branch with trunk and will not include the explanation server and explanation tabs.Iteration B1 - will be a refactoring and hardening iteration focused on making improving and stabilizing the code base.Iteration B2 - will focus on bugs that were discovered during QA of the 1.3 release and need to be resolved. Any critical 1.4 release bugs found at this point will be fixed as well.Iteration B3 - will focus on highly desirable &#34;Nice to Have&#34; features.Iteration B4 - will be dedicated to fixing defects found in 1.4 that are &#34;must haves&#34;.  Since 1.4 is currently planned to be the last major release, all critical fixes need to be resolved.
<h2 id="Protege1.4ScopeDocument-CurrentSolution">
  Current Solution
</h2>
Protégé 1.3 is in production currently and a Protege 1.3.0.1 patch release is scheduled to be released before Protege 1.4 is released.
