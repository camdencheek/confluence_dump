All Client (end-user) machines must now be updated with the new version of the client to support all updates and changes performed form the latest build Since a new version of Protégé will be installed to the machine, the current version and all corresponding files will need to be removed For now, we only update local editor&#39;s machines There are other outside editors that utilize the NCI Thesaurus instance of Protégé. They can download the new client from GForge, and access the server remotely via VPN NCI Thesaurus editors also have an option of accessing the new client remotely from a Citrix Server Once a new client has been posted on GForge, contact the Systems team to coordinate the update of the client on the Citrix server DO NOT advertise that the client is available until it has been updated properly on the Citrix server.
