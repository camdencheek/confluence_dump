        Dev:Week focused on imports, will require a few changes to:
        <ul>
          <li>
            Core and protégé-owl
          </li>
          <li>
            Protégé client and server plugins
          </li>
          <li>
            Protégé metadata
          </li>
        </ul>
         Only items user will see is a pull down allowing the user to select the active ontology.  They will be able to choose any of the imports to edit.Started working on a new version of Smallbase to demonstrate a series of imports. Bob has an authorization letter but it expires today (Oct 31).  Sherri will send a message to John today.  Bob has been interacting with Nick and will check with him and copy Sherri.

        QA:Continuing to work on automation of history testingTrying to replicate a connection error Liz reported but has been unable.  Bob says he reviewed the log and it would be difficult to reproduce.  He says the error is harmlessGilberto says security team could not find a good tool to scan Protégé so haven’t approved it for use outside of the firewall.  Not having to use VPN would make it easier on editors and might avoid some weird connection errors.

        Tracy CM:Discussed an issue with a trailing space in a synonym causing a batch edit to glitch.  This meant the export to LexEVS had issues loading.  I suggested possibly inspecting concepts being edited for old issues like trailing spaces.  Bob agreed that old data that has been through multiple systems can have issues.  No action item created.
