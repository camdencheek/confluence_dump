The publishable history files will be located at /priv-file-repo/protege/archive/Production-History.  The source history files will be located in /priv-file-repo/PROD/NCIT/&lt;hash&gt;/&lt;datetime&gt;.  The operations team will be responsible for updating the publishable history directory with the appropriate source files and generating a history file that can be loaded into LexEVS.The protege editors are responsible for generating the source history files.  Editors do a review and &#34;squash&#34; of edits weekly, which will generate a squash folder with two temporary history files.  Those are not used for producing the publishable history.  At end of month the workflow manager will do a full export of history.  This will generate the datetime folder and the 3 history files we are interested in.
<ul>
  <li>
    ncitevs_history - this is all the raw history edits since the last export
  </li>
  <li>
    cumulative_ncitevs_history - this is all the raw history edits since history was first recorded, including the current month
  </li>
  <li>
    ncitconcept_history - this is a scrubbed history with editor names and duplicate modifiy records removed.
  </li>
</ul>

  EVS History
</h2>
The cumulative_ncitevs_history is the detailed history written for internal purposes. It includes editor names and the exact date of any and all modifications to the concepts.  Protege creates a full, cumulative EVS history with every history export.  This file needs to merely be copied from the source directory to the Production-History, overwriting the file that is there.

  Concept History
</h2>
The ncitconcept_history is a scrubbed version of history that removes editor names and eliminates duplicate modifies within the same month.  While internal review might find it important that a concept has been edited 5 times in a month, external users are only informed that there have been modifications since the last release. The monthly history process examines the raw ncitevs_history and throws out all of the extra, uninformative modify records.  The resulting ncitconcept_history only shows records since the last history export.  It needs to be manually appended to the cumulative_ncitconcept_history in the Production_History folder.cp priv-file-repo/protege/archive/PROD/NCIT/&lt;hashversion&gt;/&lt;datetime&gt;/* /priv-file-repo/protege/archive/Production-Historycp cumulative_ncitconcept_history cumulative_ncitconcept_history.bakcat ncitconcept_history &gt;&gt; cumulative_ncitconcept_historyThe cumulative_ncitconcept_history must be reformatted in order to be loadable into the LexEVS terminology server.  This is done using Format_History on the processing server.  When formatting is complete, the output file &#34;concept_history.txt&#34; should be copied back to the Production-History folder as a backup.
