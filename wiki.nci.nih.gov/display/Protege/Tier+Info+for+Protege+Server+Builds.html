  Tier Info for Protégé Server Builds
</h1>
The QA, and Stage tiers follow essentially the same steps as dev tier builds. Directory structures and port numbers are similar for each tier, however, there are differences between the NCI Thesaurus and BiomedGT instances. Below is a listing of tier-specific info for Dev through Stage, also indicating different info for each instance:

A new build can be performed on any tier, or, builds can be tagged from dev, and be built from another tier Finally, if for some reason tagging malfunctions, Folders can be copied from tier to tier, but ensure that all necessary scripts and files are configured correctly to work on that particular tier. Ideally, tagging builds from dev, and building the tagged version up the tiers is the generally best method to ensure software consistency between tiers. The other methods will also work, but are not guaranteed to be as consistent and error-free.
