A sub-group represents stratification criteria that can be used to assign patients to study arms and assess study outcomes. Sub-group information is required for Complete trials only, and optional for Abbreviated trials.Â Trials can have multiple sub-group records. Each record displays the following information about the disease or conditions:
<table>
