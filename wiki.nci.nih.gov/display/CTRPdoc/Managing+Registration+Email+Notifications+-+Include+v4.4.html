The CTRP system can automatically send you an email message whenever some aspect of a trial you have submitted or own has changed. For example, the system would notify you when the CTRO has accepted a trial that you submitted. It would send another message when the Trial Summary Report (TSR) is available for review. You can choose to receive all messages or none of them.How to Manage Registration Email Messages
