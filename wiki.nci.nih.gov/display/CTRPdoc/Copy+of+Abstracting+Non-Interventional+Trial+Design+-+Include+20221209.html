            If the trial is an Expanded Access trial, select Yes. Otherwise, select No.An Expanded Access trial describes the procedure for obtaining an experimental drug or device for patients who are not adequately treated by existing therapy, who do not meet the eligibility criteria for enrollment, or who are otherwise unable to participate in a controlled clinical study. Expanded Access records are used to register all types of non-protocol access to experimental treatments, including protocol exception, single-patient IND, treatment IND, compassionate use, emergency use, continued access and parallel track.If you import an Expanded Access trial from ClinicalTrials.gov (whether via the Registration or PA web application), the system automatically sets this value to Yes. Otherwise, the default is No. The system does not include this attribute in the TSR, in the XML output to ClinicalTrials.gov, in the trial data sent to Cancer.gov, or in the set of trials provided to the

            . When a trial is listed as Expanded Access at the trial level in CTRP, the Expanded Access use of the drug/device will most likely be required by another interventional trial with an IND/IDE that is Available for Expanded Access.

                Observational. Studies among cancer patients and healthy populations that involve no interventions or alteration of the participants. Biomedical and/or health outcome(s) are assessed in pre-defined groups of participants. The participants in the study may receive diagnostic, therapeutic, or other interventions but the investigator of the observational study is not responsible for assigning specific interventions to the participants of the study.

                Ancillary-Correlative. A trial that is secondary to another trial, or a type of trial that tests for a relationship between a condition and a potential causal factor of the condition.
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    Ancillary. Studies that are stimulated by, but are not a required part of, a main clinical trial/study, and that utilize patient or other resources of the main trial/study to generate information relevant to it. Ancillary studies must be linked to an active clinical research study and should include only patients accrued to that clinical research study. Report only those studies that can be linked to individual patient or participant data.
