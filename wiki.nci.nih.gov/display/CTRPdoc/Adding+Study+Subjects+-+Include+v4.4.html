For Complete trials, lead organizations report all subjects accrued for the trial (both in the lead organization and in all participating sites). For Abbreviated trials, each participating site reports the number of its own accruals (accrual count) only. ---
<ol>
  <li>
    If your organization currently submits subject accrual information for studies to CTEP or DCP via the OPEN system, continue to report subject accrual information via OPEN. The NCI will manage the transfer of subject accrual data for OPEN trials internally. Otherwise, submit your organization&#39;s subject accrual data to CTRP.
