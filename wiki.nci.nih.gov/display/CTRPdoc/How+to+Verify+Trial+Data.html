    .Additional Notes:
    <ul>
      <li>
        A trial can capture program codes from different organization families. For example, a participating site might belong to a different organization family than the lead organization. When you amend a trial, the Program Code field displays all codes from the master list for the organization family of the lead organization.
      </li>
      <li>
        Primary Completion Dates are optional for non-interventional trials. The system excludes such trials when submitting XML documents to

        If appropriate, upload any new or updated documents. For instructions, refer to

        . If you upload an IRB document, the CTRO reviews the updated record you submit and makes changes to the record as necessary. For example, if you upload an IRB document for a trial currently in the In Review state, the CTRO updates the IRB information section of the trial record (e.g., IRB status and approval number).
