Because clinical trials can involve a network of persons and organizations, one of the key functions of a curator is to identify the interrelationships among them. You can identify each organization by the role(s) it plays in support of various clinical research activities.Organizations can exist as standalone entities without an assigned role. However, organizations that have roles in a &#34;Pending&#34; state appear in the Inbox until the roles have been curated.There are two main types of roles, as follows:
<ul>
  <li>
    Structural role– Permanent role of an organization as defined by another organization. Specifies capability and competency. Predefined structural roles are as follows:
    <ul>
      <li>
        Research organizations
      </li>
      <li>
        Health care facilitiesStructural roles do not have to be scoped by another organization.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    Functional role – Temporary role based on activities that an organization participates in. Predefined functional roles are as follows:
    <ul>
      <li>
        Identified organizations
      </li>
      <li>
        Oversight committees
