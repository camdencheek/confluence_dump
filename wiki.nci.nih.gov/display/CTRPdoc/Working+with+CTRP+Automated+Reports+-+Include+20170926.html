            Select the output type (XLSX, CSV, or PDF).
          </li>
          <li>
            Click Export Table. Depending on your selection, the system generates a Microsoft Excel (XLSX) file, comma-separated values (CSV) file or a Portable Document Format (PDF) file.
          </li>

            Download the file as indicated by your browser&#39;s prompts.
          </li>
        </ol>
        If your report contains values with leading zeros (such as in the Protocol ID column), be careful how you open the CSV file:
        <ul>
          <li>
            If you open it in a text editor, that type of application retains all leading zeros.
          </li>
          <li>
            If you open it with Microsoft Excel, that application discards leading zeros in numeric values.
          </li>
          <li>
            If you use the Text Import Feature in Microsoft Excel, you can specify the data format for each column (such as Text for the Protocol ID column).
          </li>
        </ul>
        For details, refer to the online help provided with the application you want to use.
