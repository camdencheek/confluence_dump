The Trial Identification page displays information about the trial as it was registered in the CTRP system:
<ul>
  <li>
    The top of the Trial Identification page contains pertinent aspects of the trial, including lead organization, principal investigator, and trial submitter. This summary remains visible at the top of each page as you progress through the trial validation and abstraction.To view the principal investigator’s or trial submitter’s contact information, click the appropriate link in the summary. A pop-up window displays the information.
  </li>
  <li>
    The main section of the Trial Identification page displays most of the same information as the summary in addition to other trial identifiers (including duplicate and obsolete identifiers), trial category, and trial type. The combination of these elements uniquely defines the trial in the CTRP.
  </li>
</ul>
You cannot import an Abbreviated trial from ClinicalTrials.gov that has the same NCT ID as a trial currently registered in the CTRP,  even if the existing trial has been rejected. Therefore, in some cases, you may need to delete an NCT ID from a rejected trial. If, for example, a Registration user submitted a trial as a Complete trial rather than an Abbreviated trial accidentally, the user (or you) can import the trial directly from ClinicalTrials.gov only after you delete the associated NCT ID from the existing trial.For rejected trials, the system displays a Delete icon next to the NCT ID in the Trial Identification section.
