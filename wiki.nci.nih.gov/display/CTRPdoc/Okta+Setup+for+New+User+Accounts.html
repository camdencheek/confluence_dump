What is OKTA?Okta is the multifactor authentication service provider for NCIs CTRP and Precision Medicine applications. Multifactor authentication is used to provide additional security beyond just entering a username and password: authentication is accomplished by either responding to an alert on a cell phone, pressing a key in answer to a recorded phone call, or entering a code received via text message or phone call.Even if you already use Okta for other programs, you will still need to set up Okta for your new account the first time you log in. Every user has an Okta profile that facilitates the authentication of the user into their accounts on the applications. Previously, the login process for NIH internal users displayed only the iTrust login screens, without the option to login using the Okta profile username and password.

  </li>
  <li>
    Point your cell phone towards your computer screen and align the cell phone camera display with the square of the QR code.
  </li>
  <li>
    The Okta Verify app will scan the QR code and connect your cell phone to your Okta account. You will see a new entry in the connections list in your cell phone app.

<h1 id="OktaSetupforNewUserAccounts-Two-FactorOption:MultipleMethods">
  Two-Factor Option: Multiple Methods
</h1>
It is possible to set up more than one of the authentication options. While only one method is needed for each login, and each type authentication may only be associated with one phone number, this configuration allows some flexibility for users who want the option of using two different phone numbers.Here are some examples of how this might be used:
<ul>
  <li>
    Okta Verify Authentication (cell phone), Voice Call Authentication (office phone).
  </li>
</ul>
User sets up Okta Verify authentication to send pushes to their cell phone and sets up Voice Call Authentication to their office phone number. If the user does not have cell service in their office, they can use their office phone to authenticate, and they can authenticate via Okta Verify push on their cell phone if they are away from their office.
<ul>
  <li>
    SMS Authentication (personal cell phone), Okta Verify Authentication (work cell phone).
  </li>
</ul>
User sets up Okta Verify Authentication to send pushes their company-issued cell phone and sets up SMS Authentication to their personal cell phone. The user does not wish to install an app on their personal cell phone, but would like to have a backup method of authentication in case of any changes to their work cell phone number.
<ul>
  <li>
    Okta Verify Authentication (cell phone), SMS Authentication (cell phone), Voice Call Authentication (office phone).
  </li>
</ul>
User wishes to have several options for authentication, especially since their day-to-day schedule is extremely varied. This allows the user to choose the method that best suits their situation at login time.
<ol>
  <li>
    Determine the configuration that best fits your situation and decide which of the authentication methods that you want to use and which phone number you want to use with each.
  </li>
  <li>
    Follow the earlier instructions in this document for the first login. When you get to the point of choosing an authentication method, select the first method on your list. Follow the instructions in this document for that method and connect it to your chosen phone number and complete the verification.
  </li>
  <li>
    Before logging in completely, click on the text Back to factor list in the lower left-hand corner of the window that indicates going back to the selection screen.
  </li>
  <li>
    Choose the next authentication method on your list and follow the instructions for that method.
  </li>
  <li>
    If you would like to choose a third method, click on the lower left-hand corner again to go back to the selection screen. When you have completed all of the setup configurations, you may log in to the application.
  </li>
  <li>
    Return to Step 8 in First-Time Login Steps. Note that if you have set up all 3 methods, you will not be routed back the Setup multifactor authentication window; instead you will need to set up your security question and then you will be logged in to the application.
  </li>
</ol>
Note: The next time you log in to the application, one of the authentication methods will be selected by default, but you may choose another method if you have set it up. Click on the down-arrow icon next to the Okta symbol in the window and choose a different authentication method from the picklist.

As with most user profile passwords, Okta passwords require periodic updating to maintain compliance with security policy. NIH Users also need to update their Okta password as per the update schedule, even if they choose to only use iTrust to login to the applications.Users will receive an email alerting them when it is time to update their Okta password.
