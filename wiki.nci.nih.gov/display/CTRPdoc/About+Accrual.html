Accrual is the total number of patients either currently enrolled or anticipated to be enrolled on the clinical study. Enrolled means a participant’s, or their legally authorized representative’s, agreement to participate in a clinical study following completion of the informed consent process. Potential participants who are screened for the purpose of determining eligibility for the study, but do not participate in the study, are not considered enrolled, unless otherwise specified by the protocol.

.The CTRP Accrual application provides authorized members of the cancer research community with access to their clinical study registered in CTRP for the purpose of reporting accrual. It enables users to enter accrual based on the study category: Complete or Abbreviated/Imported. Only one type of accrual reporting is permitted per study. For information on these types, refer to

    Subject: Study subject level reporting of demographic data.
    <ul>
      <li>
        Subject accrual is expected to be reported for Complete studies, both Interventional and Non-Interventional, and is the default accrual reporting type.
      </li>
    </ul>

  <li>
    Partial Subject: Requires the reporting of Study Subject ID, Registration Date and Participating Site data only. The other accrual data elements are optional.
    <ul>
      <li>
        Partial Subject accrual was implemented for unique instances when full Subject/patient-level accrual reporting is not feasible.
      </li>
      <li>
        The reporting of Partial Subject accrual on a Complete Interventional trial requires an approval request submitted to the CTRO (

            Any previously reported accrual will need to be nullified prior to the change in accrual reporting type.
