            .Keep your account up to dateThe PRS organization name is required for uploading trial records to ClinicalTrials.gov via a system-generated file. The PRS organization name you include in your profile is included in that file. This precludes having to update the PRS name in the file. Therefore it is very important for you to update your account whenever there is a change in PRS.
