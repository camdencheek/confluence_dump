        Use the Amend Trial feature (for Complete trials only) when changes to the trial involve changes to the protocol document that require Investigational Review Board (IRB) approval.Â Amendments include changes that substantively alter any of the following elements:
        <ul>
          <li>
            The treatment administered.
          </li>
          <li>
            The study design.
          </li>
          <li>
            The sites in which patients are being enrolled on the trial.
          </li>
        </ul>
        Amendments include all changes (and updates) since the last amendment to the protocol was submitted. For more information and instructions, refer to
