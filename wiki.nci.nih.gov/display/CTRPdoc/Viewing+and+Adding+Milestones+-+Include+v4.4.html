Because milestones indicate the progress of a trial, you can view, but not change recorded milestones. However, you can add records throughout the life cycle of the trial submission. You can not add milestones to trials that are currently on hold.For trials with one or more amendments, the system displays milestones in sets, one for each submission. You can add milestones only when the Submission Number is the Active Milestone set, as shown below.

If you select an Inactive Submission set, that is, one that contains a previous submission, you can not add new milestones. In the figure below, the selected Submission Number is 5 (out of 6 submissions).

An abstractor can reject an amendment submission without rejecting the whole trial.

If an abstractor has rejected an amendment submission, the system displays the last Active milestone set by default, as shown below.
