Amendments apply to Complete trials only. Amended trial validation does not pertain to Abbreviated trials. There is little difference between validating an original submission and an amended version other than the trial’s history and access to additional trial-related documents.For amended trials, you can change additional elements specific to the amendment as follows:
<ul>
  <li>
    Amendment date and amendment number on the Trial History page. See
    <a href="https://wiki.nci.nih.gov/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=341184385" rel="nofollow">
      Processing Trial History Information
    </a>
    .
  </li>
  <li>
    Assigned Amendment Reason Code on the Trial History or Trial Validation page.
  </li>
</ul>
Rejecting Amended Trial SubmissionsAfter you reject an amendment, the system verifies the rejection in a message and returns you to the Trial Identification page. The Last Submitter, displayed in the heading across the top of the page, reverts to the person who submitted the trial prior to the amendment submission.  How to Change an Amendment Reason Code
