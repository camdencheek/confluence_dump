The Site Administrator for a site is the CTRP user with the following qualities:
<ul>
  <li>
    The CTRO or another Site Administrator has granted the user profile the administrative rights.
  </li>
  <li>
    The user profile is affiliated with that site (an organization family or a single organization that does not belong to an organization family).
  </li>
</ul>
The relationships between Site Administrators and trials in a single site are as follows:
<ul>
  <li>
    An organization:
    <ul>
      <li>
        Can have one original Site Administrator.
      </li>
      <li>
        Can have many Site Administrators appointed by the original Site Administrator.
      </li>
      <li>
        Can be the lead organization for many trials.
      </li>
      <li>
        Can be the affiliated organization for many users who can submit and own trials.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    A trial:
    <ul>
      <li>
        Can have one submitter.
      </li>
      <li>
        Can have one organization affiliation, defined by the lead organization.
      </li>
      <li>
        Can have many trial owners.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    Trial ownership:
    <ul>
      <li>
        Can be implicit. By default, if a Site Administrator&#39;s affiliated organization is the lead organization for a trial, that Site Administrator is an implicit owner of that trial.
      </li>
      <li>
        Can be explicit. By default, the trial submitter is the only explicit trial owner. A Site Administrator can grant ownership of a trial to more users and can remove trial ownership from the original submitter and other users. (Refer to

          Managing Trial Ownership
        </a>
        .) If you add a Site Administrator as an owner of a trial, that Site Administrator has explicit ownership of that trial, rather than just implicit ownership.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    A Site Administrator can do the following:
    <ul>
      <li>
        Display trial ownership
      </li>
      <li>
        Manage trial ownership
      </li>
      <li>
        Manage site record ownership
      </li>
      <li>
        Manage accrual access
      </li>
      <li>
        Manage the administrative rights of other users in the organization
      </li>
      <li>
        Revoke own administrative rights
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
Â Site administrators do not receive system-generated emails automaticallyThe system sends generated emails (including TSRs) to a Site Administrator only if the Site Administrator&#39;s affiliated organization is the trial&#39;s lead organization, or if the Site Administrator is the trial submitter and/or trial owner. The Site Administrator can also manage email notification globally. For instructions, refer to
