This section contains detailed information on each of the data elements included in the Batch Upload file. Use of CDUS Values Although you can use CDUS values, they are being phased out in the CTRP. It is best, therefore, to use the CTRP values listed in the table below. When you create a batch file, ensure that each data element conforms to the requirements.
<ul>
  <li>
    List each data element in its appropriate position in a given row
  </li>
  <li>
    Use the correct character cases (CAPITAL vs. lower case letters)
  </li>
  <li>
    Use the correct character lengths (number of characters allowed in a single field)
  </li>
  <li>
    If a comma is part of the value, enclose the field in double quotes. Otherwise the use of double quotes is optional.
