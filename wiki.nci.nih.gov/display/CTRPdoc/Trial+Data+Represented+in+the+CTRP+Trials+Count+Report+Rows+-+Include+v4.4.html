The diagram is divided in two parts horizontally. The top section comprises Complete trials; the bottom section comprises Abbreviated trials. Trial types and their relationships are represented as follows:
<ul>
  <li>
    NCI managed trials (large red oval) comprise Complete trials only.
  </li>
  <li>
    NCI sponsored trials (red oval with white outline inside the NCI managed trials shape) comprise a subset of NCI managed trials only.
  </li>
  <li>
    CCR trials (rectangle with black outline) comprise a subset of NCI managed, but not NCI sponsored trials. Only trials for which the Lead Organization is &#34;NCI – Center for Cancer Research&#34; are included in this group. This group does not include trials with CTEP or DCP IDs.
  </li>
  <li>
    Consortia trials (circle with dashed outline) comprise a subset of NCI managed, but not NCI sponsored trials; and Abbreviated trials.
  </li>
</ul>
