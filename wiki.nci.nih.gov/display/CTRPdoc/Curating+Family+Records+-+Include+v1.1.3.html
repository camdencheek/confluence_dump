Families consist of one or more associated organizations. Each organization has a relationship to the family and to other organizations within the same family. Families are identified by their NCI-designated names where applicable.For example, the Mayo Clinic Cancer Center family consists of the following organizations, among others:
<ul>
  <li>
    Mayo Clinic Hospital
  </li>
  <li>
    Mayo Clinic Rochester
  </li>
  <li>
    Mayo Clinic Jacksonville
  </li>
  <li>
    Mayo Hospital
  </li>
  <li>
    Mayo Clinic Scottsdale-Phoenix

</ul>
 An organization can belong to multiple families. You can create families and add, edit, or remove organizations belonging to them. You can also assign and change the hierarchical relationships between organizations in a given family.For additional instructions, refer to the following pages:
