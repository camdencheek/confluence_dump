This section provides instructions for uploading batch files via the Accrual user interface. It also provides instructions for resolving any errors that may have occurred during the import process.The batch upload feature enables you to submit accrual data for multiple subjects and one or more trials at a time rather than having to enter data for each subject/study individually.Once you have been granted permission to submit accrual data, you can upload accrual data files singly as plain text files or in multiple text files that have been compressed into a Zip file.
