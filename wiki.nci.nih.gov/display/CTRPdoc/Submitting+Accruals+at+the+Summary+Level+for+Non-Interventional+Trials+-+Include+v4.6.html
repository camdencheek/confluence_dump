    The default accrual type for Complete Non-Interventional studies is Subject. However, if no accruals have been reported for this study, the default accrual reporting type can be changed to Summary accrual. If accrual has been reported, then the following actions are required:
    <ul>
      <li>
        Any previously reported accrual will need to be nullified prior to the change in accrual reporting type.
      </li>
      <li>
        An approval request will need to be submitted to the CTRO (

        </a>
        ) to change the accrual reporting type to Summary.

  <li>
    In the # of Subjects Enrolled field(s), enter the total cumulative number of subjects currently enrolled in this study at your site.
  </li>
  <li>
    In the Cut-Off Date field, specify the date from which the cumulative accrual count was calculated. If you do not specify a cut-off date, the system considers the accrual submission date to be the cut-off date.
  </li>
  <li>
    In the Actions column of the record you want to update, click Save (the floppy disk icon). A message at the top of the table indicates that the record has been updated successfully. Because you reported accrual counts at the summary level, you must continue to report accruals at this level in the future.
