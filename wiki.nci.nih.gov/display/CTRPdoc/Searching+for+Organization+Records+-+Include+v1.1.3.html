    Click Search. The results of your search are displayed in a table below the search criteria fields.You can sort the recordsClick the column heading once to sort the records in ascending order.  An arrow head indicates whether the sort order is descending or ascending. Click the column heading again to reverse the sort order.Search TipIf the organization you were looking for is not listed, you may have searched too narrowly (that is, you may have provided too much information about the organization). If the list of results is very long and contains many organizations that are similar to yours, you can narrow your search by providing more information. If you still don’t find your organization in the CTRP system, you can create it as a new one. For instructions, see
