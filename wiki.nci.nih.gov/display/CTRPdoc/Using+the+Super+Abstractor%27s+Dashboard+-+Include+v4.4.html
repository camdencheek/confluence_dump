With the Super Abstractor Dashboard, you can create custom searches that enable you to track the progress of, and process, clinical trials. The PA application displays the abstraction dashboard automatically each time you log in. It has the following tabbed pages:
<ul>
  <li>
    Workload page - Lists trials that require processing and sorts them by the date on which abstraction should be complete. From this page, you can change the Expected Abstraction Completion Date for a trial.
  </li>
