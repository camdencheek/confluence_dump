The system populates many of the data elements in the CTRP Users report from information provided by users about themselves in the CTRP Registration web application, when they create and manage CTRP accounts. The system populates other data elements (such as roles) from other CTRP modules (such as the PA and PO web applications).This page describes each data element and provides links to other pages that indicate how users add or view the data in each CTRP user account. The parenthetical with each link indicates the relevant CTRP web application for that link. For general account information, refer to the following pages:
