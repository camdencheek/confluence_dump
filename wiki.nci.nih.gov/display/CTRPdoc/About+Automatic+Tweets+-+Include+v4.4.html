When a triggering event takes place for a trial, the system evaluates whether that trial is eligible for a Twitter announcement. If the trial is eligible, the system submits a tweet with the following components:
<ul>
  <li>
    Base text: A new NCI-sponsored &lt;hashtags&gt; study is now accepting patients. &lt;reference_url&gt;
  </li>
  <li>
    A shortened reference URL for the trial record on cancer.gov.
  </li>
  <li>
    One or more hashtags, such as #coloncancer or #lymphoma, based on the body sites assigned to the trial.
  </li>
</ul>
Triggering events include:
<ul>
  <li>
    Trial Status change for a Complete trial
  </li>
  <li>
    Participating Site Status change for an Abbreviated (Industrial) trial
  </li>
  <li>
    Processing Status change for any trial
  </li>
  <li>
    The addition of an NCT ID to any trial
  </li>
</ul>
The system submits a tweet only when all of the following conditions have been met:
<ul>
  <li>
    The trial&#39;s Processing Status is Abstraction Verified Response or Abstraction Verified no Response.
  </li>
  <li>
    The trial meets one of the following conditions:
    <ul>
      <li>
        For Complete trials, the Trial Status is Active or Enrolling by Invitation.
      </li>
      <li>
        For Abbreviated (Industrial) trials, the Participating Site Status is Active or Enrolling by Invitation.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    A tweet has not been sent for the trial.
  </li>
  <li>
    The trial is an original submission. (That is, it is not an amendment.)
  </li>
  <li>
    The trial has an NCT ID.
  </li>
  <li>
    The trial is not flagged with the flag reason “Do not submit tweets.”
  </li>
  <li>
    The trial has been submitted to cancer.gov.
  </li>
</ul>
The system can switch off all automatic tweets. Currently, this can be done only by the development team in collaboration with the systems team.
