The system associates trials with the user who last submitted the trial, and with the last submitter&#39;s affiliated organization.  For example, in the figure below, Isabelle Autissier (username = CTRPDOC1) submitted the trial while affiliated with M D Anderson. She is the last submitter and trial owner. M D Anderson is the last submitter organization and associated with the trial.

The CTRP system identifies the trial by the last submitter and the last submitter organization. In the figure below, username CTRPDOC1 is affiliated with M D Anderson as per the account information in the figure above.

If Isabelle Autissier changes her organization affiliation, the results depend on the extent of the change:
<ul>
  <li>
    If she changes her organization affiliation to another within the organization family such as U.T. M.D Anderson Cancer Center after having submitted the trial, she retains trial ownership and her original organization retains association with the trial.

  </li>
  <li>
    If she changes her organization affiliation to an organization outside the organization family such as Vanderbilt-Ingram Cancer Center, she loses trial ownership of all trials affiliated with M D Anderson. Her trial will not be among the &#34;Search My Trials&#34; results. M D Anderson Cancer Center retains association with the trial; Vanderbilt-Ingram Cancer Center does not assumeÂ association with the trial despite the last submitter&#39;s new organization affiliation.

The example above involves Complete trials. The same principles apply to Abbreviated trials, but changes in affiliation affect association with the site record rather than association with the trial.
