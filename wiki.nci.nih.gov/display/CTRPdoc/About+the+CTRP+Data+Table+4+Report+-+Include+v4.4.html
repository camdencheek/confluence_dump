<ul>
  <li>
    Continued support of interventional CTRP-generated Data Table 4 for both competing and non-competing applications
  </li>
  <li>
    Observational CTRP-generated Data Table 4 for non-competing applications began in FY 22 (i.e., Oct 1, 2021)
  </li>
  <li>
    Ancillary-correlative trials continue to be submitted in a Center-generated Data Table 4

**The expectation is that each NCI-designated Cancer Center will maintain their own data within CTRP throughout the year and facilitate the CTRP-generated DT4 review and submission process.** For CTRP data requests/discrepancies/questions for review, please send emails to the NCI Clinical Trials Reporting Office (CTRO) mailbox
