You can search for–and abstract or edit–any registered trial that has been submitted successfully to the Clinical Trials Reporting Program (CTRP). Search criteria are available to locate a particular trial to work on, or you can list all registered trials that are available for validation and abstraction. You also can limit your search to the trials you have checked out previously.Super Abstractors can use the abstraction dashboard feature to search for trials as well. See

            To narrow the search by this trial attribute, specify one or more words from the official name of the protocol provided by the study principal investigator or sponsor (as it appears in the protocol document). Use wildcards as appropriate.Avoid specifying the entire title in the search fieldUse keywords rather than phrases or the entire title. Doing so minimizes the potential for excluding from the search results any titles with misspellings or slightly different phrasing.For information, refer to
