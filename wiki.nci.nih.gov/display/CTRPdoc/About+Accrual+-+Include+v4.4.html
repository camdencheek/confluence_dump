Accrual is the total number of patients either currently enrolled or anticipated to be enrolled on the clinical trial.  Enrolled means a participant’s, or their legally authorized representative’s, agreement to participate in a clinical study following completion of the informed consent process. Potential participants who are screened for the purpose of determining eligibility for the study, but do not participate in the study, are not considered enrolled, unless otherwise specified by the protocol.

.The CTRP Accrual web application provides authorized members of the cancer research community with access to cancer clinical trials registered with the CTRP for the purpose of reporting accrual data for clinical studies. It enables users to enter accrual based on the trial category: Complete (National, Externally Peer-Reviewed, or Institutional trials), or Abbreviated (Industrial or Other trials). For information on these types, refer to
