You can associate any number of trials with one that is currently registered in the CTRP.The trials that you associate can be those currently registered in the CTRP or those that will be registered in the future. If the trial already exists in the CTRP,Â  the system populates all the trial information for you once you search/select the trial. If the trial has not yet been registered, you can enter the trial information directly in the fields provided. Later, when the associated trial is registered, the CTRP system updates the association automatically.For instructions, refer to the following pages:
