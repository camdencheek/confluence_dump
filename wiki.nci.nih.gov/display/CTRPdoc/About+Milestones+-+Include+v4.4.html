Milestones are used to record the progress of a trial along its processing life cycle and to establish the processing status. The system establishes some milestones at specific events during the process. For example, it sets the trial processing status to &#34;Submitted&#34; for a trial that has not yet been validated, and to &#34;Accepted&#34; once the trial has been validated and accepted.The system records milestones as sets by submission number. For example, an original trial has one set of milestones (one submission), but an amended trial may have two or more submissions. Each subsequent submission has its own set of recorded milestones.The figure below illustrates the trial milestones for an accepted trial.
