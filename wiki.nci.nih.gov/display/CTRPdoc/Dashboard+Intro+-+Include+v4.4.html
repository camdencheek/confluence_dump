The abstraction dashboard enables you to track the progress of, and process, clinical trials. The PA application displays the abstraction dashboard automatically each time you log in. It has the following tabbed pages:
<ul>
  <li>
    Workload page - Lists trials that require processing and sorts them by the date on which abstraction should be complete.
  </li>
  <li>
    Details page - PA displays this page only after you have selected a trial from the Workload page. Provides details of that trial and links to the Trial Identification page, where you can do the following:
    <ul>
      <li>
        Check in and check out trials for processing
      </li>
      <li>
        Review the trial&#39;s check-out history
