This page tree provides instructions for importing disease/condition and intervention terms from the NCI Thesaurus (NCIt) to the CTRP database using NCIt term codes. If the term you import is in the CTRP database already, you can synchronize its details with the NCIt data. Additionally, it describes how to request new terms from the NCI Enterprise Vocabulary Services (EVS) and how to enter term details once EVS curators have fulfilled your request.NCI Enterprise Vocabulary Services (EVS) publishes reference terminology and core biomedical ontology in the NCI Thesaurus (NCIt). The CTRP imports NCIt biomedical concepts, terms, and codes; and synchronizes (syncs) terminology databases. (The CTRP synchronizes Preferred Names, Synonyms, and NCIt Identifiers only. It does not import/synchronize parent and child terms.) Synchronization ensures that duplicates are eliminated, and that changes in the NCIt database are updated in the CTRP database.You can import NCIt terms on demand if the term you require for abstraction does not exist in the CTRP database. Once imported, you can sync the term as needed. If a term does not exist in the NCIt (that is, if the term has not been published yet), you can request the term directly from EVS. Once EVS curators have responded to your request, you can enter new term details when abstracting trials. Later EVS publishes the new term in the NCIt. For instructions, refer to the following pages:
