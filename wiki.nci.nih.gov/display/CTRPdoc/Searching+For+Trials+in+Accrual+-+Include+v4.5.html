If you do not see any studies listed when you log in, consider the following points:
<ul>
  <li>
    Your CTRP user account must have authorization to report accrual data to your studies.
  </li>
  <li>
    Studies appear in the list after they have been registered and fully abstracted in CTRP.  The Participating Site (PS) on the study record must be in one of the recruiting statuses before accrual can be loaded/reported.
  </li>
</ul>
For instructions on each of these, refer to

</a>
.Note: You can search for a study by one or more criteria, or you can list all studies to which you have been granted access by leaving all of the search criteria fields blank. If you search by the Official Title, use keywords and wildcards rather than phrases for the entire title. Doing so minimizes the potential for excluding any titles with misspellings or slightly different phrasing from the search results. For example, a Phase II study may have been reported as a Phase 2 study.For information on study statuses, refer to
