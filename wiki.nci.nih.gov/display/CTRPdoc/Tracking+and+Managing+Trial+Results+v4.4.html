For each registered and completed trial, the Study Sponsor or Principal Investigator submits results information to the Protocol Registration and Results System (PRS) of ClinicalTrials.gov. A department of the National Library of Medicine manages the ClinicalTrials.gov website, specifically the PRS Team. While the PRS Team reviews these results in PRS, theÂ NCI Clinical Trials Reporting Office (CTRO) reviews these results in the CTRP Protocol Abstraction application (PA).This page tree provides instructions for CTRO staff to track and manage trial results. The system associates your CTRP account with your role when you log in to PA. If you have the Results Abstractor role, the system automatically displays the Results Reporting Dashboard.
