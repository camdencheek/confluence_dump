To prepare a study record:
<ol>
  <li>
    Register the study in CTRP. For information and instructions, refer to
    <a href="https://wiki.nci.nih.gov/display/CTRPdoc/Getting+Started+with+Registration" rel="nofollow">
      Getting Started with Registration
    </a>
     in the NCI CTRP Registration User&#39;s Guide.
  </li>
  <li>
    The trial must be fully abstracted and that abstraction verified before accrual can be submitted to CTRP. If the CTRO requests more information about the trial once the trial is registered, respond in a timely manner to facilitate the abstraction process.
  </li>
  <li>
    Participating sites must be in an open/recruiting study status before initial accrual can be loaded. Open/recruiting statuses include the following:
    <ul>
      <li>
        Active
      </li>
      <li>
        Available
      </li>
      <li>
        Enrolling by Invitation
      </li>
      <li>
        Temporarily Closed to Accrual
      </li>
      <li>
        Temporarily Closed to Accrual and Intervention
      </li>
      <li>
        Temporarily Not Available
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>
Note: When reporting accrual via Batch Upload and REST Services, ensure the accrual reporting type is properly set on the study(ies). Accrual records reported with a different accrual reporting type than what is on the study record will be rejected. To update the accrual reporting type for all studies other than Complete Non-Interventional, a request must be submitted to the CTRO (
<a href="mailto:ncictro@mail.nih.gov" rel="nofollow">
  NCICTRO@mail.nih.gov
</a>
) for approval. Center&#39;s can change the default accrual reporting type on Complete Non-Interventional studies within the Accrual application, as long as accrual has not been reported.  Once accrual has been reported, a request will need to be submitted to the CTRO to change the accrual reporting type to Partial Subject.
