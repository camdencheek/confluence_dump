Any registered trial that has been submitted successfully to the Clinical Trials Reporting Program (CTRP) can be abstracted or edited. The Protocol Abstraction application includes a robust set of filters on the Trial Search page to return specific trials, or groups of trials.Super Abstractors can use the abstraction dashboard feature to search for trials as well.
