The curation status you select for a record affects the way in which the CTRP displays and stores it, as follows:
<ul>
  <li>
    Nullified – Record is a duplicate of another trial. Record remains in the CTRP database, but is no longer displayed. If you nullify a record, you must select a duplicate (i.e., the record you want to keep),to replace it. For complete instructions, see

    </a>
    . You can not nullify an organization that has been assigned a structural role owned by CTEP-ECM (Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program-Enterprise Core Model).
  </li>
  <li>
    Active – Record is accurate and complete. Record is displayed in the Inbox.If the P/O Curation Portal receives a request for a change in the record, it displays the record in the Inbox marked as “Change Request.”
  </li>
  <li>
    Inactive – Record is no longer valid. Or, an entity role or relationship is no longer valid.
  </li>
  <li>
    Pending – Record is inaccurate or incomplete; or, CTEP has updated the role and the CTRO has not yet reviewed the record or changed the status to &#34;Active&#34; or &#34;Nullified&#34;. Record remains in the CTRP database, and is displayed in the Inbox unless it is nullified.
  </li>
</ul>
