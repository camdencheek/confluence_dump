The system does not change the status of participating sites when the overall trial status is no longer recruiting (Closed to Accrual and/or Closed to Accrual and Intervention).  All site(s) recruitment status will need to be manually updated to one of the Closed statuses when the overall trial is no longer recruiting and/or has reached a Terminal status (Complete/Administratively Complete/Withdrawn).
