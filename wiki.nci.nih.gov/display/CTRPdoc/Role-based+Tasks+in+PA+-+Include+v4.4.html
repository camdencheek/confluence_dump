The CTRO links each PA user&#39;s CTRP account with one of the following roles:
<ul>
  <li>
    Administrative Abstractor
  </li>
  <li>
    Scientific Abstractor
  </li>
  <li>
    Admin/Scientific Abstractor
  </li>
  <li>
    Super Abstractor
  </li>
  <li>
    Results Abstractor
  </li>
</ul>
Users can perform only those tasks that are associated with their assigned roles. In some cases the ability to perform a task depends on certain conditions, for example, whether or not the user has checked out the trial.The following table is a matrix of roles and tasks. A Yes or No in each table cell indicates whether someone with a given role can perform the task.
