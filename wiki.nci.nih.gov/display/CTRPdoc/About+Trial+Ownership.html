As a Site Administrator, you can assign and unassign trial ownership rights to multiple users in your affiliated organization and its family member organizations, and multiple trials at the same time. (Trials displayed on the Manage Trial Ownership page are those that you have submitted or those submitted by users if the trial&#39;s lead organization is the same as your affiliated organization or its family member organizations.)For example, you can grant ownership of one trial to three CTRP users within your organization. Or, you can grant one user ownership of three trials.Additionally, you can tell the system to send notifications about the trial(s) via email to the owners you assign.Users must have a CTRP account, complete with organizational affiliation, in order for you to grant them trial ownership.For Abbreviated trials, owners are responsible for updating their affiliated organization&#39;s information on trials in which their site is a participant, using the Update My Site action. Owners can update the following information:
<ul>
  <li>
    Organization family&#39;s program code
  </li>
  <li>
    Organization&#39;s local trial identifier
  </li>
  <li>
    Site principal investigator
  </li>
  <li>
    Site recruitment status and dates
  </li>
</ul>
Trial ownership requirementsIn certain circumstances, you may not be able to change trial ownership using the Manage Trial Ownership functionality. For example, you may not be able to change trial ownership if the trial status is Complete rather than Active, and the lead organization is not the trial submitter&#39;s affiliated organization.
