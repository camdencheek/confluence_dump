 When calculating accrual for the Data Table 4 report, CTRP considers various factors. Consider the following example. All names and values in this example are fictional:Participating site ABC is a member of Cancer Center Family 123 (with the relationship &#34;Organization&#34;). Site ABC reported the following accrual amounts for trial ID NCI-2015-9999:
<ul>
  <li>
    3 on 9/20/15.
  </li>
  <li>
    13 on 5/25/16.
  </li>
  <li>
    43 on 9/27/16.
  </li>
  <li>
    50 on 12/3/16.
  </li>
</ul>
At some point after the site reported the above accrual amounts, Cancer Center Family 123 generated a Data Table 4 report with the following date range: 10/1/15 - 9/30/16. In that Data Table 4 report, the accrual counts in the NCI-2015-9999 row reflect the accrual counts for site ABC as follows:
<table>
  <colgroup>
    <col/>
    <col/>
    <col/>
  </colgroup>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <th>
        Trial ID
      </th>
      <th>
        Center Reporting Period
      </th>
      <th>
        Center to Date
      </th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>
        NCI-2015-9999
      </td>
      <td>
        40
      </td>
      <td>
        43
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
The Center Reporting Period column reported 40 for site ABC because CTRP subtracted the 9/20/15 value from the 9/27/16 value. The Center to Date column reported 43 for site ABC because 43 was the last value reported in the reporting period.
