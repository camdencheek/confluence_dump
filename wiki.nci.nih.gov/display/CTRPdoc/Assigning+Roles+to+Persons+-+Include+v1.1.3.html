You can identify persons by the role(s) they play in support of various clinical research activities.The two main types of roles are as follows:
<ul>
  <li>
    Structural role – Permanent role of a person as defined by an organization. Defines the relationship between a person, an organization, and a trial. Structural roles do not have to be scoped by another person.There are several types of predefined structural roles, as follows:

      <li>
        Clinical research staffs
      </li>
      <li>
        Health care providers
