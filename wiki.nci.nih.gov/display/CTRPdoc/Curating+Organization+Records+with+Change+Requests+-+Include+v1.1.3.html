Users of applications that interface with the P/O Curation Portal, for example, Protocol Abstraction, can add, or request changes to, records in the system. New records appear in the Inbox with the status &#34;Pending&#34;. Requests for changes to existing records that have been curated previously are also displayed in the Inbox, identified in the Status column by Change Request (n) where n is the number of requests.How to Curate Records with Change Requests

    If you are not the record owner, click Override.    If more than one change has been requested, select a request from the Change Request Information drop-down list at the top right corner of the requested change record. Green asterisks next to data elements indicate changed values.   It is possible, though rare, for a change request to include values that are identical to the record you are curating. This can occur because of the differences in data between the time you curate a record and when PO fetches data from ECM.
