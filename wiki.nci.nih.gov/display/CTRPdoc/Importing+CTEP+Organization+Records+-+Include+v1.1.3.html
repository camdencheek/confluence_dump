You can import existing organization records from CTEP to the P/O Curation Portal rather than entering them into the system manually. The P/O Curation Portal system populates its records with the CTEP data based on the CTEP IDs you provide. Organizations imported from CTEP are designated &#34;Pending&#34; until they have been curated. When you change the status of the organization to &#34;Active&#34;, the system changes any associated research organizations or health care facilities that have CTEP IDs to the same status (i.e., &#34;Active&#34;) automatically.How to Import CTEP Organization Records
