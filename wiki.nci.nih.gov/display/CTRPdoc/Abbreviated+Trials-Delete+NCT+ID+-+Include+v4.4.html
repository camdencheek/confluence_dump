You cannot import an Abbreviated trial from ClinicalTrials.gov that has the same NCT ID as a trial currently registered in the CTRP,Â  even if the existing trial has been rejected. Therefore, in some cases, you may need to delete an NCT ID from a rejected trial. If, for example, a Registration user submitted a trial as a Complete trial rather than an Abbreviated trial accidentally, the user (or you) can import the trial directly from ClinicalTrials.gov only after you delete the associated NCT ID from the existing trial.For rejected trials, the system displays a Delete icon next to the NCT ID in the Trial Identification section.

To delete the NCT ID from the trial, click the Delete icon, and then confirm that you want to delete the ID.
