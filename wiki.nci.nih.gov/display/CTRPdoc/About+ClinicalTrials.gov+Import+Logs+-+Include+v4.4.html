The system captures and logs information about each trial import, including the trial status, whether or not the import failed (from validation or other error), and the user who imported the file (if other than an automatic import). You can display all log files, or filter them by date, import status, identifier, etc.For each record, the system identifies which of the imported trials require acknowledgement (in the Acknowledgement [Ack.] Pending? column) and which trials have been acknowledged (in the Ack. Performed? column). The system also indicates the type of acknowledgement (either Administrative, Scientific, or Admin and Scientific) pending or performed. The first figure below shows a ClinicalTrials.gov trial that has been updated and now requires Scientific acknowledgement. Admin acknowledgement already has been performed.The second figure below shows the same trial after Scientific acknowledgement was performed.

    Scientific. At least one record in the import log for a given trial requires Scientific acknowledgement.
  </li>
  <li>
    Admin &amp; Scientific. At least one record in the import log for a given trial requires both Admin and Scientific acknowledgement.
  </li>
</ul>
Valid values for the Ack. Performed? column are as follows:
<ul>
  <li>
    No. None of the records in the import log for a given trial that requires acknowledgement has been acknowledged.
  </li>
  <li>
    Admin. At least one record in the import log for a given trial that requires Admin acknowledgement has been acknowledged.
  </li>
  <li>
    Scientific. At least one record in the import log for a given trial that requires Scientific acknowledgement has been acknowledged.
  </li>
  <li>
    Admin &amp; Scientific.
