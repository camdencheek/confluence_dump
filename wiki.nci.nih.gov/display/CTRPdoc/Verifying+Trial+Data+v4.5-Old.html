NCI requests the verification of all trial data in CTRP at least every 6 months. The Data Verification due date is determined based on the following:
<ul>
  <li>
    Date the last data abstraction was verified (both new registration and amendment submissions) in CTRP.
  </li>
  <li>
    Date the last Update was submitted in CTRP.
  </li>
  <li>
    Date the last Data Verification was performed in CTRP
  </li>
</ul>
This request applies to Interventional trials that have the following attributes:
<ul>
  <li>
    Trial Processing Status is either:
    <ul>
      <li>
        Abstraction Verified - No Response
      </li>
      <li>
        Abstraction Verified - Response
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    Trial Status is anything other than the following:
    <ul>
      <li>
        Withdrawn
      </li>
      <li>
        Administratively Complete
      </li>
      <li>
        Complete
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    The CTRP Registration application sends Trial Owners, Trial Submitters, and Site Administrators a verification reminder on a monthly basis listing any trials that meet Trial Verification requirements: Within 30 days of their Verification Due Date (6 months past the trials Record Verification Date) or past due.
  </li>
</ul>
Each time a trial is verified, the CTRP Registration application records the Date, Verification Method and Verified By. This is true for original as well as updated trials. The Trial Data Verifications history can be found on the Trial Details and Update/Verify Trial Data pages.
