As a Super Abstractor, you can assign a priority number to a trial from the abstraction dashboard&#39;s Details page. Trial priorityÂ is an indication of the relative importance of the trial, from high priority to low, as follows:
<ul>
  <li>
    1 = High. Assigning this priority moves the trial to the top of the abstractor&#39;s list of trials to process.
  </li>
  <li>
    2 = Normal
  </li>
  <li>
    3 = Low. Assigning this priority moves the trial to the bottom of the abstractor&#39;s list of trials to process.
  </li>
</ul>
