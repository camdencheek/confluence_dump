You can import existing person records from CTEP to the P/O Curation Portal rather than entering them into the system manually. The P/O Curation Portal system populates its records with the CTEP data based on the CTEP IDs you provide. Persons imported from CTEP are designated &#34;Pending&#34; until they have been curated. When the curator changes the status of the organization to &#34;Active&#34;, the system changes any associated research organizations or health care facilities that have CTEP IDs to &#34;Active&#34; automatically.How to Import CTEP Person Records
