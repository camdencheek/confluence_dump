Abstractors use the information provided in the documents you upload in Registration to validate and complete trial data in Protocol Abstraction (PA). To facilitate data entry, the abstractors may copy and paste information from your documents into fields in the PA interface.Trial-related documents uploaded as Microsoft Word (.doc), Microsoft Excel (.xls, .xlsx, .xlsm, or .xlsb), and WordPerfect files contain text that abstractors can copy and paste directly. PDFs (portable document format) contain text that abstractors can copy  only if  the content was created from other text-based applications such as Word or Excel.Abstractors can not copy and paste text from scanned documents Avoid uploading PDFs of scanned documents. They can not be edited, copied, or read with OCR (optical character recognition) applications.Adobe provides a plug-in for most text-based word processing applications that enables you to convert your files to PDFs.

  Granting and Revoking Administrative Authority
</h2>
The Site Administrator for a site is the CTRP user with the following qualities:
<ul>
  <li>
    The CTRO or another Site Administrator has granted the user profile the administrative rights.
  </li>
  <li>
    The user profile is affiliated with that site (an organization family or a single organization that does not belong to an organization family).
  </li>
</ul>
The relationships between Site Administrators and trials in a single site are as follows:
<ul>
  <li>
    An organization:
    <ul>
      <li>
        Can have one original Site Administrator.
      </li>
      <li>
        Can have many Site Administrators appointed by the original Site Administrator.
      </li>
      <li>
        Can be the lead organization for many trials.
      </li>
      <li>
        Can be the affiliated organization for many users who can submit and own trials.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    A trial:
    <ul>
      <li>
        Can have one submitter.
      </li>
      <li>
        Can have one organization affiliation, defined by the lead organization.
      </li>
      <li>
        Can have many trial owners.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    Trial ownership:
    <ul>
      <li>
        Can be implicit. By default, if a Site Administrator&#39;s affiliated organization is the lead organization for a trial, that Site Administrator is an implicit owner of that trial.
      </li>
      <li>
        Can be explicit. By default, the trial submitter is the only explicit trial owner. A Site Administrator can grant ownership of a trial to more users and can remove trial ownership from the original submitter and other users. (Refer to
        <a href="https://wiki.nci.nih.gov/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=350228638" rel="nofollow">

        .) If you add a Site Administrator as an owner of a trial, that Site Administrator has explicit ownership of that trial, rather than just implicit ownership.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    A Site Administrator can do the following:
    <ul>
      <li>
        Display trial ownership
      </li>
      <li>
        Manage trial ownership

      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
 Site administrators do not receive system-generated emails automaticallyThe system sends generated emails (including TSRs) to a Site Administrator only if the Site Administrator&#39;s affiliated organization is the trial&#39;s lead organization, or if the Site Administrator is the trial submitter and/or trial owner. The Site Administrator can also manage email notification globally. For instructions, refer to

Site Administrators can authorize users to submit subject accrual data for trials that have been fully abstracted and verified. Once assigned, users can submit accrual data for all trials associated with their affiliated organization or organization family members. For Complete trials (National, Externally Peer-Reviewed, or Institutional), the organization must be a lead; for Abbreviated trials (Industrial or Other), the organization must be a participating site.Assignment at the organization level pertains to trials that the organization has registered in CTRP and extends to those that it will register in the future. Similarly, assignment at the organization family level pertains to trials that any member organization has registered in CTRP and extends to those that it will register in the future.Only the CTRO has access to CTEP and DCP trial accruals.

If the trial you want to register does not have an NCI ID, or if you do not know it, contact the CTRO for assistance at
<a href="mailto:ncictro@mail.nih.gov" rel="nofollow">
  ncictro@mail.nih.gov
</a>
.   The system registers the trials you import from ClinicalTrials.gov as Abbreviated trials. To classify a trial as &#34;Other&#34;, contact the Clinical Trials Reporting Office staff at

    If the system does not find a match in the CTRP, the trial record from ClinicalTrials.gov appears.
  </li>
  <li>
    Click Import Trial From ClinicalTrials.gov.While it is possible for two users to attempt to import a trial at the exact same time, the system cannot process simultaneous imports. If you receive an error message the first time you attempt to import a trial, wait a short while, and then try again.The trial is registered in the CTRP and assigned a unique NCI identifier with the processing status Submitted. The system synchronizes the imported record in the CTRP with the one in ClinicalTrials.gov.
  </li>
  <li>
    To add your site as a participant in the trial, click Add My Site. The Add Participating Site page appears. The Participating Site list contains all organizations in the Organization Family associated with your CTRP account.

  Working with Clinical Trial Search Results
</h2>
The search results table lists the trials that match your search criteria, as well as additional criteria, including a trial processing status. This status reflects the work of the Clinical Trials Reporting Office (CTRO). The CTRO reviews each trial submitted to the system in order to validate submitted information. During the validation process, the reviewers check for duplicate records and ensure that the submitter has provided all required information. CTRO does one of the following as part of the validation process, before abstraction:
<ul>
  <li>
    If all data is complete and accurate, the reviewers assign the trial the status &#34;Accepted,&#34; and the system notifies the submitter by email.
  </li>
  <li>
    If information is missing, or there are discrepancies in the information provided, the reviewers can place a trial on hold. The CTRO contacts the submitter for clarification and/or to request missing documents, and resumes processing once the trial is validated.
  </li>
  <li>
    If the trial is a duplicate (i.e., another user has submitted the same trial), the reviewers assign the trial the status &#34;Rejected,&#34; and the system sends the submitter an email message indicating the status and reason for the rejection. Reviewers may also reject a trial if CTEP/DCP/CCR has approved the trial. NCI transfers these trials internally.
  </li>
</ul>
If you have questions about a rejected trial, contact the CTRO at
<a href="mailto:ncictro@mail.nih.gov" rel="nofollow">

</a>
