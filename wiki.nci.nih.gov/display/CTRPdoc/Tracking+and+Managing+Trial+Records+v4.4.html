This page tree provides instructions for tracking and managing trial records using the PA abstraction dashboards. The PA application has one abstraction dashboard for each of the following roles:
<ul>
  <li>
    Super Abstractors
  </li>
  <li>
    Administrative Abstractors
  </li>
  <li>
    Scientific Abstractors
  </li>
  <li>
    Administrative/Scientific Abstractors
  </li>
</ul>
The system associates your CTRP account with your role when you log in to PA, and automatically displays the Workload page of the appropriate abstraction dashboard.
