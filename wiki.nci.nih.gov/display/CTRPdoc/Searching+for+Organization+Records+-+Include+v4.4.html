If the list of results is very long and contains many organizations that are similar to the one you are searching for, you can narrow your search by providing more information.

    If the organization does not appear in the results table, do one of the following to modify your search:
    <ul>
      <li>

      </li>
      <li>
        To narrow your search so that fewer organizations are listed in the search results, provide more about your organization. For example, if you searched by state in your original search, you may want to search by city in addition to the state.
