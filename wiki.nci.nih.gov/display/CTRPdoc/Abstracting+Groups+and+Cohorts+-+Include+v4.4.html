Group/cohort information pertains to Complete non-interventional trials only. In non-interventional studies, cohorts are groups of individuals, initially defined and composed, with common characteristics (e.g., condition, birth year), who are examined or traced over a given time period.When adding groups to a trial, you assign to them the interventions currently abstracted for the trial. For instructions on abstracting interventions, refer to
<a href="https://wiki.nci.nih.gov/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=343082653" rel="nofollow">
  Abstracting Interventions
</a>
.The following rules apply to each trial:
<ul>
  <li>
    There must be at least one group/cohort that implies that the entire study subject population receives the same intervention.
  </li>
  <li>
    The number of groups/cohorts added to the trial must coincide with the number indicated in the trialâ€™s Design Details. See
    <a href="https://wiki.nci.nih.gov/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=343082640" rel="nofollow">

    .
  </li>
  <li>
    Every group/cohort must have at least one assigned intervention.
  </li>
  <li>
    Every intervention must be assigned to at least one group/cohort.
  </li>
  <li>
    A trial must have only one group with the same combination of description and associated intervention.
  </li>
</ul>
Trials can have multiple group/cohort records. Each record displays the following group information:
<table>
  <colgroup>
    <col/>
