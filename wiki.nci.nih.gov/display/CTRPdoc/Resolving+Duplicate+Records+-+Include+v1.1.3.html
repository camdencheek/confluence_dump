To ensure that there are no duplicate, or near-duplicate records in the system, search the CTRP database for the organization name before you create a new organization record or begin to curate an existing one. This is especially true for organizations with similar names. For example, organizations that are members of the same family may contain part of the family name.If you find a duplicate record in the system, nullify the one you are currently curating. When you select the duplicate, the system merges the roles from the nullified organization to the duplicate one (the record  already in the system) automatically.If the system detects conflicts when merging the roles of the nullified organization, it will nullify the conflicting information associated with the nullified organization and copy over any contact information to the role of the duplicate organization.How to Search For Duplicate Records

  </li>
  <li>
    Provide as much information about the organization as you can, and then click Search. You must use at least one search criterion. The search results represent the organizations that you can select as a duplicate of the record you are curating.Do not select as a duplicate the same organization that you are currently curating. Doing so will nullify the organization.
  </li>
  <li>
    To select the record that you want to replace the one you are currently nullifying, in the Action column, click Select. If the search results do not return a duplicate, click Back to Search Form and search for the organization using different criteria. The ORG-ID (organization identifier) of the duplicate you selected is displayed in the Basic Identifying Information section on the Organization Details page.   The organization name and aliases will be merged into the Duplicate of the Organization.

  <li>
    Optionally, at the bottom of the Organization Details page, enter any comments you may have in the Comments text field.
  </li>
  <li>
    Click Save. Or, to return to the organization without nullifying it, click Reset. Although the record you were curating is essentially removed from view, the CTRP stores the record with a status “nullified.” The status of the duplicate record you selected does not change.
