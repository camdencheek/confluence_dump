You can import NCIt terms on demand if the term you require for abstraction does not exist in the CTRP database. Once imported, CTRP syncs the term with in the NCIt database automatically.If a term does not exist (i.e., has not been published yet) in the NCIt, you can request the term directly from EVS. Once EVS curators have responded to your request, you can enter new term details when abstracting trials. Later EVS publishes the new term in the NCIt. Refer to
