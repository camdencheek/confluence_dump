        <ul>
          <li>
            An organization is a member of the specified organization family on any date in the reporting period (on or after the reporting period start date and on or before the reporting period end date).

          <li>
            This organization is a participating site on a trial.

          <li>
            This trial had an open status at this site on any date in the reporting period.
          </li>
