To filter the search results, in the Search field, type one or more characters contained in any of the fields. The list is filtered as you type subsequent characters.For example, in the figure below, the results list has been filtered to display only trials that contain &#34;004&#34; in the NCI Identifier.

Adding one more character, as shown below, filtered out the remaining trial because the number &#34;9&#34; was not included in the NCI Identifier.
