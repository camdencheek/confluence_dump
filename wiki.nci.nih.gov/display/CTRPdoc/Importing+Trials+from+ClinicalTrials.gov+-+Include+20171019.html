For all of these types of imports, keep in mind the following points:
<ul>
  <li>
    If the system finds a match between a trial in ClinicalTrials.gov and a rejected one in the CTRP, the system will not import the trial. For instructions, refer to
    <a href="https://wiki.nci.nih.gov/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=356522028" rel="nofollow">

    </a>
    .
  </li>
  <li>
    If the Official Title does not exist for an imported trial, the system substitutes the Brief Title as the Official Title. If ClinicalTrials.gov later adds an Official Title, then during the nightly update, the system updates the Official Title of the trial in the CTRP database to match the ClinicalTrials.gov Official Title.

    Log files are recorded for each import. For information, refer to
