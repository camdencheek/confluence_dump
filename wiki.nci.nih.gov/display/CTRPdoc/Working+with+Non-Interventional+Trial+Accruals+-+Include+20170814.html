This section describes how to submit and update accruals for non-interventional trials. Summary/cumulative level accrual is reported for each participating site by the Lead Organization.Â The summary level consists of the accrual count per site only. However, if there are no accrual records for your trial in CTRP currently, you can enter demographic accrual information at the study subject, or patient level. Once a participating site has recorded accruals, you can no longer choose which level to use; you must enter subsequent accrual data at the same level.For instructions, refer to the following pages:
