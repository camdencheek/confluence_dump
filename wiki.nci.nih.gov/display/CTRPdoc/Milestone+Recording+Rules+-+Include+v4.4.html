Your ability to record milestones depends on trial processing statuses. The following diagram illustrates the basic workflow of trial processing statuses. The rules that follow it provide more detailed information about the order in which you can record the milestones.

The following rules determine the order in which you can record the milestones:
<ul>
  <li>
    You can record most milestones multiple times per trial, following the order of the trial submission processing life cycle. However, you can add the following milestones only once per trial submission:
    <ul>
      <li>
        Submission Received Date
      </li>
      <li>
        Submission Rejection Date
      </li>
      <li>
        Initial Abstraction Verified Date
      </li>
      <li>
        Initial Submission to ClinicalTrials.gov
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    You cannot record milestones with a future date.
  </li>
  <li>
    Each milestone date must follow the preceding milestone date.
  </li>
</ul>
