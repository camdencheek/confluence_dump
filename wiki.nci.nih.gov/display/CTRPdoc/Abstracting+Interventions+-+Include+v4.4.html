You can search for, and select, interventions from a stored list of active intervention terms extracted from NCIt and link them to a trial. NCIt is an online database developed and maintained by the National Cancer Institute Enterprise Vocabulary Services. You can find more detailed information about NCIt at

.Additionally, Protocol Abstraction provides a structure for describing drug, radiation, and surgical procedure details. It generates a description from values you provide for such parameters as dose, target site, frequency of administration, etc.Obsolete termsSome intervention terms become obsolete over time. When you validate the trial, the system displays an error message if the abstraction contains an obsolete term. If this occurs, look up the intervention name and replace the obsolete term with the new one.Trials can have multiple intervention records. Each record displays the following information about the intervention:Intervention data definitions

        For drug interventions, a summary of the drug’s chemical nature and (potential) mechanism of action, and/or details such as dosage form, dosage, frequency, and duration. For other interventions, a summary of the procedure or device that provides key details that distinguish it from similar interventions.TipYou can generate descriptions for drug, radiation, and surgical procedure interventions using Protocol Abstraction’s structured approach.
