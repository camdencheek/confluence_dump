Abbreviated/Imported trials: Accrual is expected to be reported using the Summary Accrual type (this is the default accrual reporting type). Summary accrual is reported by each participating site. Summary level consists of only a cumulative accrual count per site. Centers can change the default accrual reporting type to Subject (which includes reporting of demographic data) or Partial Subject (which requires the reporting of only Study Subject ID, Registration Date and Participating Site data only) within the CTRP Accrual application as long as there is no accrual recorded for the trial record in CTRP. If accrual has been reported, the accruals will need to be nullified and an approval request will need to be submitted to the CTRO (
