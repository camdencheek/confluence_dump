You can record, update, or delete the number of patients that your site accrued to date per Abbreviated or Other trial.You can record/update/delete accrual counts only if you are a registered member of one or more of the Participating Sites or you are affiliated with the site for a given trial. The CTRP system records each COUNT you submit as the total (cumulative) number of subjects accrued to date, no matter how frequently you submit them. That is, the system does not add the count you enter here (or by the batch submission process) to previously-recorded counts.For example, if you submit an initial 10 subjects in December, the CTRP system records the counts you submit the following March per the table below.

Do not submit a count that is less than the previously submitted count unless the previous submission was an errorIf you submit a new count that is less than the CTRP system previously recorded, the CTRP system considers your previous submission an error. Do not submit a lesser value unless you are intentionally correcting/deleting accruals. For example, if the CTRP system previously recorded 100 subjects, and you submit 85, the CTRP system records 85.
