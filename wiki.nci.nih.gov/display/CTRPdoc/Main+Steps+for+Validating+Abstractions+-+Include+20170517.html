During the process of completing a trial abstraction, the system checks all abstracted data for potential errors and omissions, and all required fields for consistency. For example, it compares the number of arms reported in the interventional trial Design Details with the number of arm records listed on the Arms page.Major steps for completing an abstraction currently in the &#34;Accepted&#34; or &#34;Abstracted Verified (Response and No Response)&#34; trial processing status are as follows:
<ol>
  <li>
    Check the abstract for errors by navigating to the Abstraction Validation page.
  </li>
  <li>
    Review any errors/omissions listed on the Abstraction Validation page in order to make corrections as necessary.
  </li>
  <li>
    Repeat the validation cycle as many time as necessary.
  </li>
  <li>
    View the TSR (Trial Summary Report) and the XML report.
  </li>
</ol>
