Site Administrators can authorize users to submit subject accrual data for trials that have been fully abstracted and verified. Once assigned, users can submit accrual data for all trials associated with their affiliated organization or organization family members. For Complete trials (National, Externally Peer-Reviewed, or Institutional), the organization must be a lead; for Abbreviated trials (Industrial or Other), the organization must be a participating site.Assignment at the organization level pertains to trials that the organization has registered in CTRP and extends to those that it will register in the future. Similarly, assignment at the organization family level pertains to trials that any member organization has registered in CTRP and extends to those that it will register in the future.Only the CTRO has access to CTEP and DCP trial accruals. The table below outlines the access and trial assignment rules for Complete and Abbreviated trials.

        The system automatically assigns the organization family Accrual Submitter access to any trial registered by new organizations added to an organization family in the future. It withdraws access if anyone removes the organization family Accrual Submitter&#39;s organization from the organization family in the future.
