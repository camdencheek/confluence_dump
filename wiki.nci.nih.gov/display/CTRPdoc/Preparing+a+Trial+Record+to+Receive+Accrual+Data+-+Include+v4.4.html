To prepare a trial record:
<ol>
  <li>
    Register the trial in CTRP. For information and instructions, refer to
    <a href="https://wiki.nci.nih.gov/display/CTRPdoc/Getting+Started+with+Registration" rel="nofollow">
      Getting Started with Registration
    </a>
    in the NCI CTRP Registration User&#39;s Guide.
  </li>
  <li>
    The trial must be fully abstracted and that abstraction verified before accrual can be submitted to CTRP. If the CTRO requests more information about the trial once the trial is registered, respond in a timely manner to facilitate the abstraction process.
  </li>
  <li>

    <ul>
      <li>
        Active

      <li>
        Available
