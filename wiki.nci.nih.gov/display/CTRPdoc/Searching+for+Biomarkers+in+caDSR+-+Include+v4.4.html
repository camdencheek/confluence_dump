  Adding Biomarkers to the NCIt Database
</a>
.The search feature enables you to search for biomarkers listed in caDSR. You can search for biomarkers by the following criteria:
<ul>
  <li>
    Search Term. Search for biomarkers meanings that contain the search term
  </li>
  <li>
    Search Scope. Search for biomarkers that contain the search term in their preferred permissible values only, in their synonyms (alternate names) only, or in both (the default).
  </li>
  <li>
    Public ID. Search for biomarkers by their Public IDs only
  </li>
</ul>
If you provide the marker&#39;s Public ID, you must enter it exactly, in its entirety.Additional search options include the following:
<ul>
  <li>
    Case-sensitivity. You can elect to make the search term case-sensitive or insensitive. Searches are case-insensitive by default.
  </li>
  <li>
    Highlighting search terms. Query text in search results is highlighted by default to make search terms easier to identify. You can turn on or off query text highlighting in the search results.
  </li>
</ul>
Most search results list primary terms followed by all possible synonyms in parenthesis in the following order:
<ul>
  <li>
    Exact matches for the Primary term
  </li>
  <li>
    Matches that contain the search term alone (i.e., the term is not part of a larger term)
  </li>
  <li>
    All other matches that contain the search term
  </li>
</ul>
The CTRP system synchronizes its data with the caDSR terminology database nightly. In rare instances--for example, if CTRP was unable to connect with caDSR--you will receive a notice that the synchronization failed. The systems synchronize automatically the following night.How to Search for Markers in caDSR
