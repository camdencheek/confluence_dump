The diagram below illustrates the flow and transitions among trial statuses. The system records the statuses in the order indicated by the arrows. Double-ended arrows indicate that a transition between statuses can be recorded in either order. For example, a status can transition from Active/Enrolling by Invitation to Temporarily Closed to Accrual and Intervention, or conversely, from Temporarily Closed to Accrual and Intervention to Active/Enrolling by Invitation.
