When you submit the trial, the system checks the ClinicalTrials.gov identifier you entered to ensure that no other registered trial has the same one. The system displays an error message if it finds another trial with the same ClinicalTrials.gov identifier. If this occurs, check the number you entered and try again. If you are certain that the number you entered is correct, contact the CTRO at
