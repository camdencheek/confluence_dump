Valid dates for a given trial status depend on the other values you have entered, and whether those dates are Actual or Anticipated. The following table illustrates these rules:

The general rules for Study Date types are as follows:
<ul>
  <li>
    If the date is in the past, the type must be Actual.
  </li>
  <li>
    If the date is today, the type could be Actual or Anticipated.
  </li>
  <li>
    If the date is in the future, the type must always be Anticipated.
  </li>
  <li>
    If the study status is either Complete or Administratively Complete, the Completion Date is expected to be Actual.
  </li>
</ul>
The general rules for Study Date values are as follows:
<ul>
  <li>
    The Study Start Date can be in the past, present, or future.
  </li>
  <li>
    The Primary Completion Date is always the same as, or later than, the Study Start Date.
  </li>
  <li>
    If the Primary Completion Date is Actual, it can be earlier than the Current Study Status Dates forÂ Complete or Administratively Complete statuses.
  </li>
  <li>
    The Completion Date is always the same as, or later than, the Primary Completion Date.
  </li>
</ul>
*CTRP expects that the Completion Date will be Actual when the Current Study Status is Complete or Administratively Complete, but the system allows either an Actual or Anticipated value.
