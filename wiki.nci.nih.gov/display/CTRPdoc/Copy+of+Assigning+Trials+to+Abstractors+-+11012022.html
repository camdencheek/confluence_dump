As a Super Abstractor, you can assign a trial to another PA user for processing. The user must be affiliated with your organization.When you assign a trial to an abstractor, the system does the following:
<ul>
  <li>
    If the trial is already checked out by someone else, the system checks it back in, stamps it with the current date and time, and then checks it out to the selected abstractor (again using the current date).
  </li>
  <li>
    If the trial is not checked out by someone else, the system checks out the trial to the abstractor based on the abstractorâ€™s role. For example, if the abstractor is a scientific abstractor, the system checks the trial out for scientific abstraction.
  </li>
</ul>
