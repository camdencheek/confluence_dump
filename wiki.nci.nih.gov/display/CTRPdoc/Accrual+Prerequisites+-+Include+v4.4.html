Before you can submit accrual data to a given trial in CTRP, the system requires the following:
<ul>
  <li>
    You must have a CTRP user account with authorization to submit accrual to your trials.
  </li>
  <li>
    The trial (Externally Peer-Reviewed, Institutional, or Industrial) must be registered in CTRP and fully abstracted.  If a trial has been rejected or terminated in CTRP, you will not be able to submit accrual on the trial record.  Rejected and submission terminated trials will not display for your center in CTRP Accrual.
  </li>
</ul>
For instructions on each of these, refer to the following pages:
