A calculated date, by default. The system calculates this date as follows:
<ul>
  <li>
    If the trial has any reactivation dates, the system starts with the most recent one.
  </li>
  <li>
    Otherwise, the system starts with the submission date.
  </li>
  <li>
    The system adds ten business days.
  </li>
  <li>
    The system adds any number of days in which trial was on hold waiting for information from the submitter. (If the trial has any reactivation dates, the system considers only days on hold since the most recent reactivation date.)
  </li>
  <li>
    The system requires this date to fall on a business day.
  </li>
</ul>
(A business day isÂ any weekday that is not a Federal holiday. For a list of Federal holidays, refer to the U.S. Office of Personnel Management&#39;s list of
