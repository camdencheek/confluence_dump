The procedure for searching for diseases while adding or entering study subject records is the same as that for searching for them using the Disease Search menu. The difference is that in addition to searching for diseases, you can select them for association with the study subject record. How to Search for and Select Diseases

    In the Disease Name field, type part or all of the disease/condition or site being studied, or, in the Disease Code field, enter part or all of the disease or site code.Search tipsType as many letters of the disease/condition or site name as possible to reduce the number of search results. The system adds wildcards on both sides of the search string (the series of letters you type) for you implicitly. You can type wildcard symbols (%) between characters of the string as necessary.   The following table lists codes for disease not specified, healthy volunteer, and donors:

    From the Disease Code System drop-down list, select one of the following:
    <ul>
      <li>
        ICD-9 (International Classification of Diseases, 9th Revision)
      </li>
      <li>
        ICD-10 (International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision)
      </li>
      <li>
        ICD-O-3 (International Classification of Diseases for Oncology, 3rd Edition)
      </li>
      <li>
        SDC (CTEP&#39;s Simplified Disease Classification)
      </li>
    </ul>
    If the trial has at least one existing study subject record, the Disease Code System displays only the code system associated with the existing record(s). This ensures that all subjects in the study share the same terminology.
