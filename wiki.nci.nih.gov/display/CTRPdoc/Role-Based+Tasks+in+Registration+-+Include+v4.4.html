Each person who registers for a CTRP account is associated with a role. One registered user from an organization can request an Administrator role from the CTRO. That Administrator can grant administrative privileges to other users in the Administrator&#39;s organization.CTRP account holders can perform only those tasks that are associated with their assigned roles.The following table is a matrix of roles and tasks. A Yes or No in each table cell indicates whether someone with a given role can perform the task.
