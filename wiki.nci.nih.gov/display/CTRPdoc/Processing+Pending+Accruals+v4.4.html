The system processes CTEP (Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program) and DCP (Division of Cancer Prevention) accrual records submitted in batch files to the CTRP via CDUS (Clinical Data Update System). If a batch file contains accruals for a site that has not been added to a given trial in the CTRP, the system generates an email message to the submitter that includes a list of the sites for which accruals were submitted but not recorded. These sites&#39; accrual records remain in a separate table, or queue, pending further processing.The system re-submits and processes the batch files daily. If the system subsequently finds that a participating site has been added to the trial in the CTRP, it removes the site from the pending accruals queue.However, if it finds that the site still has not been added in the CTRP, it notifies the submitting Super Abstractor who can then add the site to the trial in PA. If the Super Abstractor determines that the error-producing participating site is invalid, the site and its accrual records can be deleted from the queue. The Pending Accruals feature is available to Super Abstractors only. How to Process Accruals in the Pending Accruals Queue
