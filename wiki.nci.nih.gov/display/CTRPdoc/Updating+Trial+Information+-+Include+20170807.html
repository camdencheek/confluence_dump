  <li>
    Make changes to the fields as necessary. The system requires you to provide information for all fields marked with an asterisk (*). The instructions are the same for trial registration and trial update, with some exceptions:
    <ul>
      <li>
        If applicable, enter a ClinicalTrials.gov ID, and then click Add ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier. You cannot change the ClinicalTrials.gov ID once you have added it. Also, if the trial record already has a ClinicalTrials.gov ID, you cannot change it. If the ClinicalTrials.gov ID specified for a trial is incorrect, contact the CTRO at
        <a href="mailto:NCICTRO@mail.nih.gov" rel="nofollow">
          NCICTRO@mail.nih.gov
        </a>
        .When you submit the trial, the system checks the NCT number you entered to ensure that no other registered trial has the same one. The system displays an error message if it finds another trial with the same NCT number. If this occurs, check the number you entered and try again. If you are certain that the number you entered is correct, contact the CTRO at

        A trial can accumulate program codes from different organization families. For example, a participating site might belong to a different organization family than the lead organization. When you update a trial, the Program Code field displays all codes from the master list for the organization family of the lead organization.

      <li>
        Primary Completion Dates are optional for non-interventional trials and for DCP trials. In both cases, the system excludes such trials when submitting XML documents to ClinicalTrials.gov. Otherwise, Primary Completion Dates are required.
      </li>
      <li>
        If appropriate, upload any new or updated documents. For instructions, refer to

          Uploading Trial-Related Documents
        </a>
        . If you upload an IRB document, the CTRO reviews the updated record you submit and makes changes to the record as necessary. For example, if you upload an IRB document for a trial currently in the In Review state, the CTRO updates the IRB information section of the trial record (e.g., IRB status and approval number).
