When you receive a CTRO request for access, you must associate the user with the appropriate study/site. Thereafter you can grant or deny the user access without having to repeat the setup.Organization Administrators assign accrual access in CTRP Registration. However, you still can use this feature in the Protocol Abstraction application to process requests that have been sent to the CTRO.How to Manage Accrual Access
