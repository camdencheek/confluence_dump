If you did not find a given biomarker in caDSR, The Research Scientist must review the term to determine if a request must be sent to caDSR. If the marker is a gene, the Research Scientist should access HUGO (via the link in the request form). The HGNC-approved symbol should be requested as the primary term, followed by any appropriate synonym from the protocol in parenthesis. The HGNC ID number should also be included in the request after selecting the Found in Hugo? check box.How to Request Markers from HUGO for Addition to the caDSR Database
