The way in which you register trials in the CTRP depends on a combination of the trial&#39;s Data Table 4 Categorization as either Complete or Abbreviated, your affiliated organization and its role in the trial, and whether the trial currently is registered in ClinicalTrials.gov with an NCT ID. (For the definition of   Complete  and  Abbreviated, refer to

.)Keep in mind the following points about the entities in CTRP that represent NCI-designated Cancer Centers:
<ul>
  <li>
    A CTRP organization family represents an NCI-designated Cancer Center family of organizations. For brevity, this guide refers to this entity as a Cancer Center family, a Cancer Center, or an organization family.
  </li>
  <li>
    A CTRP organization that is a member of a Cancer Center family is considered a Cancer Center organization. For brevity, this guide refers to this entity as a Cancer Center organization.

            Cancer Center trials must meet the following criteria to be eligible for registration:
            <ul>
              <li>
                Trials must have been active as of January 1, 2009 or any time thereafter.

            <ul>
              <li>
                If NCI-managed, trials must have been active as of January 1, 2009 or any time thereafter.

                If NCI-sponsored, trials must have been still open (not yet Completed) as of December 26, 2007 or opened anytime thereafter.Cancer Centers do not register PIO-managed trials or NCI-CCR trials. PIO-managed trials are submitted to CTRP directly by CTEP and DCP. NCI-CCR trials are managed in ClinicalTrials.gov by CCR.

        If your trial is Abbreviated, registration differs according to a combination of the following trial attributes:
        <ul>
          <li>
            NCT ID (which indicates that the trial has been registered with ClinicalTrials.gov)
          </li>
          <li>
            Cancer Center type (NCI-designated Cancer Centers or other centers)

            Lead organization
          </li>
        </ul>
        Guidelines for Trials with NCT IDsIf the trial is an Industry funded trial, and has an NCT ID, then it can be imported into CTRP from ClinicalTrials.gov in most cases. In some special cases, however, the trial cannot be imported directly and instead you must contact the CTRO for assistance.
        <ul>
          <li>
            If your organization is not an NCI-designated Cancer Center organization, NIH institute, or pharmaceutical company, you will need to import the trial directly from ClinicalTrials.gov. For instructions on this process, refer to

        The system assigns the trial you import from ClinicalTrials.gov the Data Table 4 Category (funding source) Industrial/Other. (For information, refer to

            If your organization is the Lead Organization on a trial, and your organization is an NCI-designated Cancer Center organization, do not import the trial from ClinicalTrials.gov. Instead, submit the trial to CTRP as a Complete trial. For instructions, refer to

            If your organization is the Lead Organization for any trial on anything other than an NCI-designated Cancer Center organization, NIH institute, or pharmaceutical company trial, the CTRO contacts the Center and further categorizes the trial as Other/National or Other/Externally Peer-Reviewed based on whether your trial is conducted under an NIH grant, as follows:
            <ul>
              <li>
                If your trial is conducted under an NCI grant, the CTRO categorizes it as a Consortia trial.
              </li>
              <li>
                If your trial is not conducted under an NCI grant, the CTRO categorizes it as follows:

                  <li>
                    Other/National, for trials sponsored by an NIH institute
