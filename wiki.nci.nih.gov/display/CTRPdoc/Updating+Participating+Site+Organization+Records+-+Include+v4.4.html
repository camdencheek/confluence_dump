If you are affiliated with a Cancer Center organization that has been added to a trial as a participating site, the following points indicate whether you can update that participating site:
<ul>
  <li>
    If you added an organization as a participating site to a trail, you will be the participating site-record owner and can update information about that organization in the same trial record.
  </li>
  <li>
    If you are affiliated with an organization and that organization is a participating site on a trail, you can update information about that organization in the same trail record.
  </li>
  <li>
    If you are a Site Administrator and your affiliated organization is in a Cancer Center family, you can update your organization&#39;s sibling sites on a trail(that is, other participating sites in the Cancer Center family).
  </li>

    If you are not a Site Administrator and are affiliated with a Cancer Center family, you must request Site Administrator privileges from your Site Administrator before you can update any organization that is a participating site in the family.
