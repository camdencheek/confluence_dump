What is OKTA?Okta is the multifactor authentication service provider for NCIs CTRP and Precision Medicine applications. Multifactor authentication is used to provide additional security beyond just entering a username and password: authentication is accomplished by either responding to an alert on a cell phone, pressing a key in answer to a recorded phone call, or entering a code received via text message or phone call.Even if you already use Okta for other programs, you will still need to set up Okta for your new account the first time you log in. Every user has an Okta profile that facilitates the authentication of the user into their accounts on the applications. Previously, the login process for NIH internal users displayed only the iTrust login screens, without the option to login using the Okta profile username and password.

  Two-Factor : Multiple Methods
</h2>
It is possible to set up more than one of the authentication methods. While only one method is needed for each login, and each type of authentication may only be associated with one phone number, this configuration allows some flexibility for users who want the option of using two different phone numbers.Here are some examples of how this might be used: - Okta Verify Authentication (mobile phone), Voice Call Authentication (office phone).User sets up Okta Verify authentication to send push notifications to their mobile phone, and sets up Voice Call Authentication to their office phone number. If the user does not have mobile service in their office, they can use their office phone to authenticate, and they can authenticate via Okta Verify push on their mobile phone if they are away from their office. - SMS Authentication (personal mobile phone), Okta Verify Authentication (work mobile phone).User sets up Okta Verify Authentication to send push notifications to their company-issued mobile phone, and sets up SMS Authentication to their personal mobile phone. The user does not wish to install an app on their personal mobile phone, but would like to have a backup method of authentication in case of any changes to their work mobile phone number.- Okta Verify Authentication (mobile phone), SMS Authentication (mobile phone), Voice Call Authentication (office phone).User wishes to have several methods for authentication, especially since their day-to-day schedule is extremely varied. This allows the user to choose the method that best suits their situation at login time.
<ol>
  <li>
    Determine the configuration that best fits your situation and decide which of the authentication method(s) that you want to use, and which phone number you want to use with each.
  </li>
  <li>
    When the Okta “Set up multifactor authentication” window launches, configure the desired multifactor authentication per the instructions above.
  </li>
  <li>
    The next time you log into the application, one of the authentication methods will be selected by default, but you may choose another method you have set up. Click on the down-arrow icon next to the Okta symbol in the window and choose a different authentication method from the picklist.
  </li>
</ol>
