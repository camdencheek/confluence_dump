At any given time during the course of the trial validation and abstraction processes, trial discrepancies (for example, missing required documents, inconsistencies in trial information, etc.) may arise that require further clarification from the Administrative Team Lead or trial submitter. In such cases, put the trial on hold.The following steps are required before placing or releasing a trial on hold during validation:
<ul>
  <li>
    Provide a specific description, and include your initials. Example: Correct: Trial does not have a protocol document; contacted trial submitter/RM. Incorrect: Clarification on protocol document/RM.
  </li>
  <li>
    For internal questions related to workflow procedures, ask the Administrative Team Lead for guidance. Otherwise, email the trial submitter immediately to resolve discrepancies. Do not accept the trial until the problem is resolved.
  </li>
  <li>
    When the issue is resolved with the Administrative Team Lead or the trial submitter, take the trial off hold.
  </li>
</ul>
Review and track all incomplete submissions and trials with discrepancies often to ensure the trials are processed accordingly.The system sends an on-hold notice to the submitter and trial record owners as soon as you put the trial on hold for the following reasons: a) Submission Incomplete, and b) Submission Incomplete - Missing Documents. It then sends on-hold reminder email messages to the submitter and trial record owners automatically every three (3) business days. (A business day isÂ any weekday that is not a Federal holiday. For a list of Federal holidays, refer to the U.S. Office of Personnel Management&#39;s list of

.)  If no response is received within one week, send a follow-up reminder via email. If no response is received within one week after the second email, call the trial submitter. If no resolution or response is available, take the trial off hold.How to Place a Trial Record On Hold
