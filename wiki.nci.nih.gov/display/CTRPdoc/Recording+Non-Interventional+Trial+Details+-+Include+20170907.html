          <li>
            Observational. Studies among cancer patients and healthy populations that involve no interventions or alteration of the participants.
          </li>
          <li>
            Ancillary-Correlative. A trial that is secondary to another trial, or a type of trial that tests for a relationship between a condition and a potential causal factor of the condition.
            <ul>
              <li>
                Ancillary. Studies that are stimulated by, but are not a required part of, a main clinical trial/study, and that utilize patient or other resources of the main trial/study to generate information relevant to it. Ancillary studies must be linked to an active clinical research study and should include only patients accrued to that clinical research study. Report only those studies that can be linked to individual patient or participant data.
              </li>
              <li>
                Correlative. Laboratory-based studies using specimens to assess cancer risk, clinical outcomes, response to therapies, etc. Report only those studies that can be linked to individual patient or participant data.

        <ul>
          <li>
            Cohort. Group of individuals, initially defined and composed, with common characteristics (e.g., condition, birth year), who are examined or traced over a given time period

          <li>
            Case-control. Group of individuals with specific characteristics (e.g., conditions or exposures) compared to group(s) with different characteristics, but otherwise similar

          <li>
            Case-crossover. Characteristics of case immediately prior to disease onset (sometimes called the hazard period) compared to characteristics of same case at a prior time (i.e., control period)
          </li>
          <li>
            Ecologic or community studies. Geographically defined populations, such as countries or regions within a country, compared on a variety of environmental (e.g., air pollution intensity, hours of sunlight) and/or global measures not reducible to individual level characteristics (e.g., health care system, laws or policies median income, average fat intake, disease rate)
