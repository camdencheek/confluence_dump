You can register Industrial/Other trials in the CTRP by importing them directly from ClinicalTrials.gov. You must enter a ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier (NCT ID) for each trial you register. If the trial you want to register does not have an NCI ID, or if you do not know it, contact the CTRO for assistance at

The system synchronizes Industrial and Other trials currently registered in the CTRP with ClinicalTrials.gov trials every night by comparing their ClinicalTrials.gov Identifiers. The system updates CTRP trial records with the data imported from ClinicalTrials.gov if it finds matching records.     The CTRP system does not import Person information from ClinicalTrials.gov.
