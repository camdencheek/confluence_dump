The system evaluates participating site statuses on a trial to determine whether that trial should be included in a Data Table 4 report. The following table demonstrates whether the system includes trials in the Data Table 4 report or excludes trials from the Data Table 4 report, based on participating site status:

After the system determines that a trial should be included in a Data Table 4 report, the system includes all accrual for the organization family on that report.
