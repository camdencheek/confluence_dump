The search results table lists the trials that match your search criteria, as well as additional criteria, including a trial processing status. This status reflects the work of the Clinical Trials Reporting Office (CTRO). The CTRO reviews each trial submitted to the system in order to validate submitted information. During the validation process, the reviewers check for duplicate records and ensure that the submitter has provided all required information. CTRO does one of the following as part of the validation process, before abstraction:
<ul>
  <li>
    If all data is complete and accurate, the reviewers assign the trial the status &#34;Accepted,&#34; and the system notifies the submitter by email.
  </li>
  <li>
    If information is missing, or there are discrepancies in the information provided, the reviewers can place a trial on hold. The CTRO contacts the submitter for clarification and/or to request missing documents, and resumes processing once the trial is validated.
  </li>
  <li>
    If the trial is a duplicate (i.e., another user has submitted the same trial), the reviewers assign the trial the status &#34;Rejected,&#34; and the system sends the submitter an email message indicating the status and reason for the rejection. Reviewers may also reject a trial if CTEP/DCP/CCR has approved the trial. NCI transfers these trials internally.
  </li>
</ul>
If you have questions about a rejected trial, contact the CTRO at
