Trial status refers to the current stage or state of participant/patient enrollment in a clinical trial relative to other stages. CTRP uses the same statuses at the trial level and at the participating site level. The following table lists the valid trial statuses used in CTRP and maps each value to the corresponding ClinicalTrials.gov-defined recruitment value. For information on Expanded Access trial statuses, refer to
