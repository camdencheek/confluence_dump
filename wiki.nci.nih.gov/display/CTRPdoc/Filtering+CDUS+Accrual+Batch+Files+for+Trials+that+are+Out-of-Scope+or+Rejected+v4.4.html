CTEP provides a set of CDUS files for accrual batch upload into CTRP quarterly. A subset of these files contain trial records that trigger errors upon upload to the CTRP because they were closed prior to January, 2009, have been rejected during trial processing previously, or are missing in the CTRP. Files corresponding to these trials are flagged with errors at each subsequent quarterly submission.To minimize errors, Super Abstractors can designate each trial as either Out of Scope, or Rejected.During each subsequent quarterly submission, the system compares the batch files with trials in the list, and processes them as follows:
<ul>
  <li>
    If it finds a match with a trial that has been designated either Out of Scope, or Rejected, the system disregards the trial&#39;s accrual batch file and removes the trial from the list.
  </li>
  <li>
    If it finds a match with a trial that has no designation (i.e., left blank), the system submits the trial&#39;s accrual batch file. After successful submission, the system removes the trial from the list.
  </li>
</ul>
