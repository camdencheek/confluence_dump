Trials are conducted in participating sites. Information about the site (organization), investigator(s), and primary contacts (if a central contact is not provided) must be abstracted. Information about participating sites can be included in the protocol document or in the Participating Sites document.The system assigns investigators and primary contacts a status code that corresponds to the person’s/role’s curation status.Abstracting Participating Site Information

A contact can be added by providing a person’s name (i.e., someone who is associated with the trial itself), or a generic contact can be added (i.e., someone who is associated with the site but not necessarily the trial) by providing a person’s title (functional role). Both types of contacts can not be added in the same record. An abstraction cannot be completed if a primary contact is not assigned.If an investigator is designated as the primary contact (on the Investigators tab), the investigator&#39;s name is displayed on the Contact tab.
