  Generating the CTRP Data Table 4 Report
</a>
.CTRP Data Table 4 reporting for interventional trials (non-competing CCSG applications) started in FY18 (after October 1, 2017).   NCI transitioned to CTRP DT4 for interventional trials for competing CCSG applications in FY20 (started May 25, 2020 submissions).

 Scope of Trials on the ReportFor a trial to be included on a Cancer Center’s CTRP Data Table 4 report, the trial must be “Open” at both the Overall Trial-level and at the Participating Site-level for the selected reporting period.  CTRP DT4 logic looks at the first Open and first Closed recruitment statuses for the Overall Trial and the Site when deciding which trials to include on a report.Open statuses include the following:
<ul>
  <li>
    Active
  </li>
  <li>
    Available
  </li>
  <li>
    Enrolling by Invitation
  </li>
  <li>
    Temporarily Closed to Accrual
  </li>
  <li>
    Temporarily Closed to Accrual and Intervention
  </li>
  <li>
    Temporarily Not Available

        <ul>
          <li>
            If detailed accrual information was reported for the trial, the system calculates accrual within the specified time period (such as 12 months) based on the Subject Registration Date.
          </li>
          <li>
            If summary accrual was reported (such as for Industrial trials), the system calculates accrual for a selected time period as follows:
            <ul>
              <li>
                If a cut-off date is available, the system calculates accrual based on the cut-off date.
              </li>
              <li>
                If a cut-off date is not available, the system uses the accrual registration date as the cut-off date.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>
        The system calculates accrual for a selected time period based on the difference between the last summary accrual reported before the time period and the last summary accrual reported within the time period. If no summary accrual was reported before the time period selected, the system displays the last summary accrual reported within the time period as the accrual count for the time period.For an example, refer to
