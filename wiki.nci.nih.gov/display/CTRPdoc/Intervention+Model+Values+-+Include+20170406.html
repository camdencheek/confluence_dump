<ul>
  <li>
    Single Group. Single-arm study (i.e., all patients receive the same intervention).
  </li>
  <li>
    Parallel. Patients are assigned to one of two or more intervention arms for the duration of the study.
  </li>
  <li>
    Cross-over. Participants receive one of two alternative interventions during the initial phase of the study and receive the other intervention during the second phase of the study (only assigned when the protocol specifically says this is the intervention model; otherwise, default to parallel).
  </li>
  <li>
    Factorial. Two or more interventions, each alone and in combination, are evaluated in parallel against a control group (only assigned when the protocol specifically says this is the intervention model; otherwise, default to parallel).
  </li>
  <li>
    Sequential Assignment. Groups of participants are assigned to receive interventions based on prior milestones being reached in the study, such as in some dose escalation and adaptive design studies.
