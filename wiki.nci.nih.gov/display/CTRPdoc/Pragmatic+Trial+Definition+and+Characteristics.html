Pragmatic Clinical Trials Definition: A clinical trial that is designed to study a health intervention in a real-world setting that is similar or identical to the one in which the intervention will be implemented CTRP classifies trials with the following characteristics as pragmatic:
<ul>
  <li>
    Unit of randomization may be other than an individual participant (e.g., the clinic, the healthcare system, or a neighborhood if a community setting)
  </li>
  <li>
    Intervention may be multi-level involving changes to:
    <ul>
      <li>
        Participant behavior (e.g., completing a symptom report measures online), and
      </li>
      <li>
        Provider behavior (e.g., receiving the participantâ€™s symptom report and having to act on it)
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    Data are often obtained directly from medical records and, are likely collected on a large number of participants
    <ul>
      <li>
        Data may be collected during a pre-intervention period and again during a post-intervention period in each clinic that is randomized
      </li>
      <li>
        Participants for whom data are collected in the pre-intervention period may not be the same ones for whom data are collected in the post-intervention period
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
