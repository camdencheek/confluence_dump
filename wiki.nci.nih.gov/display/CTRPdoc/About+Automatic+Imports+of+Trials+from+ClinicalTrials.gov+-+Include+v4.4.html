The system imports Industrial and Consortia trials registered in ClinicalTrials.gov into the CTRP database nightly. Because these trials have been assigned ClinicalTrials.gov Identifiers (NCT IDs), the system attempts to match them with trials currently registered in the CTRP that also have NCT IDs:
<ul>
  <li>
    If the system cannot find a trial in the CTRP with the same ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier, the system imports the trial as a new trial.
  </li>
  <li>
    If the system finds a matching ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier, the system updates the CTRP record with the data imported from ClinicalTrials.gov. (If the system finds a match between a trial in ClinicalTrials.gov and a rejected one in the CTRP, the system will not import the trial. For instructions, refer to
