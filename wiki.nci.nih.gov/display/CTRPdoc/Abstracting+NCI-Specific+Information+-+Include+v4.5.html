NCI-Specific Information applies to Complete and Abbreviated trials. For Abbreviated trials, indicate whether or not the trial is Industrial.Trial categories are now referred to as Study Sources. Refer to
<a href="https://cancercenters.cancer.gov/GrantsFunding/eData#dt4" rel="nofollow">
  https://cancercenters.cancer.gov/GrantsFunding/eData#dt4
</a>
for further information about terminology for NCI-Specific and Data Table 4 information.Included in this section is the option, for certain trials, to include them in, or exclude them from, the batch of trials that CTRP sends to ClinicalTrials.gov via FTP nightly.How to Abstract NCI-Specific Information
<ol>
  <li>
    Search for the trial of interest. For instructions, refer to
    <a href="https://wiki.nci.nih.gov/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=349342831" rel="nofollow">
      Searching for Trials in PA
    </a>
    .
  </li>
  <li>
    In the search results, click the NCI Trial Identifier link for that trial. The Trial Identification page appears.
  </li>
  <li>
    On the Trial Identification page, check out the trial. For instructions, refer to
    <a href="https://wiki.nci.nih.gov/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=341184378" rel="nofollow">
      Checking In and Checking Out Trials
    </a>
    . (This checkout step is optional for Super Abstractors.)
  </li>
  <li>
    On the Administrative Data menu, click NCI Specific Information. The NCI Specific Information page appears. It displays different fields according to the trial&#39;s Data Table 4 category (study source) and the criteria described in the matrix in
    <a href="https://wiki.nci.nih.gov/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=356522011" rel="nofollow">
      Conditions for Sending Trial Information to ClinicalTrials.gov
    </a>
    .  The following factors determine which fields appear on this dialog box:
    <ul>
      <li>
        If the lead organization for the trial belongs to an organization family, the Program Code field is available. The Program Code field lists all program codes available for that organization family.
      </li>
      <li>
        CTRP does not send Abbreviated trials in the batch files, and therefore does not display the option to indicate whether to send the trial.
      </li>
      <li>
        For a Complete trial that has been sent to ClinicalTrials.gov in the batch files previously, CTRP does not display the option to indicate whether to send the trial in the future.
      </li>
      <li>
        For a Complete, NCI-sponsored trial, CTRP displays the option to indicate whether to send the trial in the future and the Comments field. The default setting for this option depends on whether the trial has been sent to ClinicalTrials.gov previously:
        <ul>
          <li>
            For an original submission (which therefore has not been sent to ClinicalTrials.gov previously), the option to indicate whether to send the trial defaults to Yes, but CTRP displays the option to exclude the trial in the future.
          </li>
          <li>
            For a trial that may have been updated and that had not been sent to ClinicalTrials.gov when submitted originally, it defaults to No, but CTRP displays the option to send the trial in the future.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    On the NCI Specific Information page, in the various fields, specify the appropriate information. The following table describes the fields. An asterisk (*) indicates a required field.
