The Responsible Party can be either a sponsor or a principal investigator (PI). The term &#34;responsible party&#34; is either of the following:
<ul>
  <li>
    Sponsor of the clinical trial (as defined in 21 CFR 50.3 or successor regulation) - or -
  </li>
  <li>
    Principal investigator of such clinical trial if so designated by a sponsor, grantee, contractor, or awardee, so long as the principal investigator is responsible for conducting the trial, has access to and control over the data from the clinical trial, has the right to publish the results of the trial, and has the ability to meet all of the requirements for the submission of clinical trial information.
  </li>
</ul>
The system displays different fields depending on what you select:
<ul>
  <li>
    If you indicate that the Responsible Party is the Principal Investigator, this section expands to display the investigator&#39;s title and organization affiliation. The investigator&#39;s name is generated from the name you selected as Principal Investigator in the Lead Organization/Principal Investigator section.
  </li>
  <li>
    If you indicate that the Responsible Party is the Sponsor-Investigator, this section expands to display the investigator&#39;s name and title. The investigator&#39;s name is generated from the name you selected as Principal Investigator in the Lead Organization/Principal Investigator section. However, you can change the investigator&#39;s name in this case.
  </li>
</ul>
