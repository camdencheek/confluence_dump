Accessing your trialsIf you do not see any studies listed when you log in, consider the following points:
<ul>
  <li>
    Your CTRP user account must have authorization to submit accrual data to your trials.
  </li>
  <li>
    Trials appear in the list after they have been registered and fully abstracted in CTRP.  The Participating Site (PS) on the trial record must be in one of the recruiting statuses before accrual can be loaded/submitted.
  </li>
</ul>
For instructions on each of these, refer to

    <img alt="Top portion of Trial Search page" width="720" src="https://wiki.nci.nih.gov/download/attachments/embedded-page/CTRPdoc/Searching%20for%20Trials%20in%20Accrual%20-%20Include%20v4.4/trial-search.png?api=v2">
  </li>
  <li>
    Enter the NCI Trial Identifier, ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier, for Official Title in the fields provided.
  </li>
  <li>
    Press ENTER or click Search Trials.You can search for a trial by one or more criteria, or you can list all trials to which you have been granted access by leaving all of the search criteria fields blank. If you search by the Official Title, use keywords and wildcards rather than phrases or the entire title. Doing so minimizes the potential for excluding any titles with misspellings or slightly different phrasing from the search results. For example, a Phase II trial may have been recorded as a Phase 2 trial.The Search Trials page refreshes and displays the trial(s) you searched for.
