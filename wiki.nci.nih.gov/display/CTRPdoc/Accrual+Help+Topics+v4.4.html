  About CTRP Accrual
</h2>
Accrual is the total number of patients either currently enrolled or anticipated to be enrolled on the clinical trial.  Enrolled means a participant’s, or their legally authorized representative’s, agreement to participate in a clinical study following completion of the informed consent process. Potential participants who are screened for the purpose of determining eligibility for the study, but do not participate in the study, are not considered enrolled, unless otherwise specified by the protocol. For more information, refer to
<a href="https://prsinfo.clinicaltrials.gov/definitions.html#IntEnrollment" rel="nofollow">
  https://prsinfo.clinicaltrials.gov/definitions.html#IntEnrollment
</a>
.The CTRP Accrual web application provides authorized members of the cancer research community with access to cancer clinical trials registered with the CTRP for the purpose of reporting accrual data for clinical studies. It enables users to enter accrual based on the trial category: Complete (National, Externally Peer-Reviewed, or Institutional trials), or Abbreviated (Industrial or Other trials). For information on these types, refer to
<a href="https://wiki.nci.nih.gov/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=341184465" rel="nofollow">

  https://cancercenters.cancer.gov/GrantsFunding/eData#dt4
</a>
.The CTRP Accrual web application allows users to enter the following types of accrual data:
<ul>
  <li>
    Patient level: Study subject demographic data for Externally Peer-Reviewed and Institutional trials. (Accruals for National trials are reported internally at NCI.)
  </li>
  <li>
    Summary level: Patient accrual counts for Abbreviated trials that have been abstracted (that is, trials that have been fully abstracted) as well as those that have been approved or withdrawn.

Accessing your trialsIf you do not see any studies listed when you log in, consider the following points:
<ul>
  <li>
    Your CTRP user account must have authorization to submit accrual data to your trials.
  </li>
  <li>
    Trials appear in the list after they have been registered and fully abstracted in CTRP.  The Participating Site (PS) on the trial record must be in one of the recruiting statuses before accrual can be loaded/submitted.

  <li>
    Enter the NCI Trial Identifier, ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier, for Official Title in the fields provided.
  </li>
  <li>
    Press ENTER or click Search Trials.You can search for a trial by one or more criteria, or you can list all trials to which you have been granted access by leaving all of the search criteria fields blank. If you search by the Official Title, use keywords and wildcards rather than phrases or the entire title. Doing so minimizes the potential for excluding any titles with misspellings or slightly different phrasing from the search results. For example, a Phase II trial may have been recorded as a Phase 2 trial.The Search Trials page refreshes and displays the trial(s) you searched for.

    In the Disease Name field, type part or all of the disease/condition or site being studied, or, in the Disease Code field, enter part or all of the disease or site code.Search tipsType as many letters of the disease/condition or site name as possible to reduce the number of search results. The system adds wildcards on both sides of the search string (the series of letters you type) for you implicitly. You can type wildcard symbols (%) between characters of the string as necessary.
