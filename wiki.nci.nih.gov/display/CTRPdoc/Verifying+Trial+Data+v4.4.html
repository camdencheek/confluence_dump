NCI requires that trial owners, trial submitters, and members of the Clinical Trials Reporting Office (CTRO) staff verify their open trial records twice per year to ensure that information is accurate and up-to-date.Â This requirement applies to Interventional trials that have the following attributes:
<ul>
  <li>
    Trial processing status is either Abstraction Verified - No Response or Abstraction Verified - Response
  </li>
  <li>
    Trial status is anything other than the following:
    <ul>
      <li>
        Withdrawn
      </li>
      <li>
        Administratively Complete
      </li>
      <li>
        Complete
      </li>
    </ul>
    The system sends trial owners, trial submitters, and site administrators a verification reminder 30 and 15 days before their trial data verification due dates. It sends reminders to CTRO staffs 7 days before the due date.
  </li>
</ul>
CTRO staffs are responsible for verifying the types of trials below. Trial owners and submitters are responsible for verifying all others.
<ul>
  <li>
    NCI-managed trials (trials with DCP or CTEP IDs)
  </li>
  <li>
    NCI-sponsored trials
  </li>
  <li>
    Trials imported from ClinicalTrials.gov
  </li>
  <li>
    Trials submitted by users affiliated with the National Cancer Institute or National Cancer Institute Division of Cancer Prevention
  </li>
  <li>
    Trials submitted by the NCI Center for Cancer Research (CCR)
  </li>
</ul>
Each time you verify a trial, the CTRP system records your name and date of verification. This is true for original as well as updated trials. You can view these records at any time, but cannot change them.For additional instructions, refer to the following pages:
