This section describes how to report and update accruals for Non-Interventional studies. Summary level accrual is reported for each participating site by the Lead Organization. The Summary level consists of the cumulative accrual count per site only. However, if no accrual records have been reported for the study in CTRP, you can choose to enter demographic accrual information at the Subject level (study subject level reporting of demographic data) or Partial Subject level (requires the reporting of Study Subject ID, Registration Date and Participating Site data only) by updating the default accrual type for the study within the CTRP Accrual application. NOTE:  Only one type of accrual reporting is allowed per study and only the CTRO can update the accrual type on a study once accrual has been reported.If you need assistance updating the default accrual type within the CTRP Accrual application or updating the accrual type once accrual has been reported, please contact the CTRO (
