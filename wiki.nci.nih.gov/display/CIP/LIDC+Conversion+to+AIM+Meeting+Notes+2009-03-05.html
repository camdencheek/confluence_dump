  Meeting Notes:

  <li>

    <a href="https://wiki.nci.nih.gov/display/Imaging/AnnotationOfAnnotation+Sample+Files" rel="nofollow">

    <ol>
      <li>
        annotation of annotation would be a good place to put the PMAPs
      </li>
      <li>
        Does max output match nodules regardless of whether they&#39;re &gt;3 mm or &lt;3mm?
      </li>
      <li>
        We can work with Sam offline and he has a record of all markings
      </li>
      <li>
        Sam says MAX does not do anything with the Non-nodules when there is not spacial correlation with another &#34;nodule&#34; lesion
      </li>
      <li>
        Many situations where some radiologists mark something as a big nodule and others mark it as a non-nodule
      </li>
      <li>
        We need to run a test of how MAX behaves when there is a mixed opinion of whether something is a nodule or non-nodule (Sam to forward an example)
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>
    New type needed for describing matching nodules in AnnotationOfAnnotation.
    <ol>
      <li>
        None of the current types really match the needs of this project
      </li>
      <li>
        Suggested creation of a new type called &#34;Nodule Matching&#34;
      </li>
      <li>
        Pat will discuss with Dave Channin about adding this in to AIM 2.0
      </li>
      <li>
        This will be a value domain, not a complex type
      </li>
      <li>
        Tony: if this is a value domain the schema will not need to be changed
      </li>
      <li>
        If we&#39;re going to add an attribute or data type we&#39;ll need to regenerate the AIM data service.  Tony can help Qinyan with doing this.
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>
    What values of id that grid service expects in AIM object---question for Tony.
    <ol>
      <li>
        it is sometimes unclear about how to handle &#34;ID&#34; attributes
      </li>
      <li>
        Tony: ID is not being treated as a primary key
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>
    Name conventions/formats for name and uniqueIdentifier attributes of ImageAnnotation tag.
    <ol>
      <li>
        Qinyan, John, Justin will discuss offline due to time constraints in the meeting
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>
    Overview of MAX nodule mapping progress
    <ol>
      <li>
        this was covered in agenda item #1 as part of the annotation of annotation discussion
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>
    RADLEX term curation
    <ol>
      <li>
        John: we want to update RADLEX with LIDC terms
      </li>
      <li>
        Sam: maybe we should discuss before doing something like this
      </li>
      <li>
        John: discussion/review on these terms would occur in the RADLEX committee that approves terms  (Sam to get us details on the findings of this)
      </li>
      <li>
        Sam: group at DePaul did a comparison of LIDC/RADLEX terms in the past
      </li>
      <li>
        Sam: if RADLEX wants to assume the duty of comparison and sign off he&#39;s ok with it
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>
    Misc issues raised
    <ol>
      <li>
        Service date/time - we are going to preserve the LIDC service date in AIM
      </li>
      <li>
        Class comment attribute - use this to identify AIM annotations as having come from LIDC
      </li>
      <li>
        Raised creation of &#34;franken-AIM&#34; that would basically be AIM &#34;v1.NCIA&#34;.  Pat would prefer not to have to manage two separate models (this one + AIM 2.0).  Alpha model of AIM 2.0 integration may be possible if pending funding issues are addressed.
