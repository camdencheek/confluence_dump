      QC tool is not functional due to system time-outs.  Current implementation times out upon performing just about any change in visibility status making it effectively unusable.  All changes in visibility are currently being routed to the dev team who have to manually write a SQL query to change the visibility status as requested and then submit a ticket to app support to have the database modified.

      Problems requiring removal of data are not actionable without DBA actions on back-end.  It is a regular occurrence when first starting a new collection that a few tries might be required before getting the anonymization schema correct.  It would be extremely helpful if we could clean up these test attempts via the QC tool.  The current process is to route these requests through the dev team who manually generate appropriate SQL queries who then submit a ticket to App Support.  This takes away time that the dev team could be working on new features or bug fixes.  Also, for remote deployments, cancer centers might not have the technical expertise readily available to deal with issues like this the way that CBIIT does.

      Problems with provenance attribution are not addressable.  Over time we have had multiple scenarios where it has been decided to break apart a collection into small sub collections.  We have also had situations where a submission came in with typos in these fields.  Rather than having to resubmit everything we have opted instead to correct the information in the database.  Doing this follows the same procedures mentioned above for when we need to delete images.  It would again increase overall efficiency if data administrators could do this themselves without relying on technical personnel.

      Zipping the images is time consuming and resource intensive.  It creates a duplicate copy of whatever the user requested for a 10 day period, meaning that a user who chooses to download very huge data sets could effectively take down the server by sucking up the remaining free space on the hard disks as the zip files are generated.  It would be better if NBIA instead installed a plugin or java web start type of thin client on the user&#39;s machine that allowed NBIA to serve them the files directly without zipping.  It would be ideal if this thin client allowed the user to pause their downloads and resume at a later time if necessary.

      Currently the NBIA system has no way of knowing how much data was actually sent to it via CTP.  Verification that nothing was lost during a submission is done manually by asking the submitter to count the total number of images they sent and then comparing it to the reports generated by the Verify Submission tool in NBIA.  CTP and NBIA should be able to communicate with each other to automate this process, making it easier to find out if any images didn&#39;t get submitted properly and to be able to resolve any problems that come up.
