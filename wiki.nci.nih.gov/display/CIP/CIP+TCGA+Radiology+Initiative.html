  Pilot Phase

A pilot project was performed in 2010 centered around the development of informatics tools to analyze the radiological data in combination with the the existing clinical, genetic, and pathological data in the

. CIP worked with both Henry Ford and UCSF to collect and de-identify the DICOM data for a

and load this data into the NCI Center for Bioinformatics and Information Technology (CBIIT) instance of the

. In parallel NCI&#39;s caBIG program funded the extension of 3 existing DICOM workstations to support standardized markup and characterization of these images utilizing the Annotated Imaging and Markup (AIM) XML standard. This effort has since led to a number of projects attempting to analyze this data.

Continuing these efforts CIP is working to accrue images from additional sites for both GBM and the other tissue types being collected as part of the original TCGA project. These efforts are being maintained on
