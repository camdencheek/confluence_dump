  Summary
</h1>
808 abdominal CT cases from the seminal department of defense (Virtual) CT Colonography clinical trial of testing 3D visualization of CT slices as an aid to colon polyp detection. Results were reported in N Engl J Med. 2003 Dec 4;349(23):2191-200 by PJ Pickhardt. The study resulted in polyp detection sensitivities in the 93% range, which approximated that of optical colonoscopy in the same patients. The results were published in NEJM in 2003 and the study was considered ground-breaking by the colon-polyp screening community. Original CT digital files from the study cases obtained at WRAMC and NMC San Diego were transferred to NBIA to serve as a resource of CTC CAD research and commercial development. The collection contains the original DICOM CT image studies and data abstracts of the radiology and optical colonoscopy reports, as well as pathology reports of removed polyps.Disclaimer: This collection is made available from the Walter Reed Army Medical Center Virtual Colonoscopy Collection in collaboration with National Cancer Institute, NIH: If you use this data or images from this web site in publications, research manuscripts, proposals, or other technical documents, you must acknowledge that the data has been provided courtesy of Dr. Richard Choi, Virtual Colonoscopy Center, Walter Reed Army Medical Center.

Sept 22, 2009Data redundancy issue found and corrected:SD VC-129M v. SD VC-127M SD VC-318M v. SD VC-316M SD VC-476M v. SD VC-475M WRAMC VC-154M v. WRAMC VC-107M WRAMC VC-268M v. WRAMC VC-267MThe patients in the above patient id pairs, 1. Both are visible 2. Both have the same number of study/series, and same study instance UID and series instance UIDs 3. Both have curation data (from uploaded spreadsheet) except SD VC-475M 4. Both curation data have similar CDE with different valuesWhat we have done is to removed the second case in each pair and their data to reduce the duplication. In addition, all 10 patient&#39;s data are stored separately off-line.
