Note: As of May 2011 CIP has launched
<a href="http://cancerimagingarchive.net/" rel="nofollow">
  The Cancer Imaging Archive (TCIA)
</a>
, an imaging archive service utilizing a customized/enhanced version of caBIG&#39;s NBIA software and staffed by a team of contractors that include DICOM and de-identification experts.  Registration is free and a number of high value image collections have already been made available since launch -
<a href="https://wiki.cancerimagingarchive.net/display/Public/Collections" rel="nofollow">

.  TCIA is now the official in vivo cancer imaging archive for NCI/CIP.

  Project Goals:
</h3>
The Cancer Imaging Program&#39;s (CIP) informatics team were in need of a standards based de-idenfication procedure for images that were being submitted to the
<a href="http://imaging.nci.nih.gov" rel="nofollow">
  National Biomedical Imaging Archive (NBIA).
</a>
In February of 2009 we contacted David Clunie for input on this and he directed us to the DICOM Working Group 18 draft (v03) of Supplement 142.  CIP then gathered a small group of industry experts to discuss how this could be implemented in the
<a href="http://mircwiki.rsna.org/index.php?title=CTP-The_RSNA_Clinical_Trial_Processor" rel="nofollow">
  RSNA&#39;s Clinical Trial Processor (CTP)
</a>
software. The primary identified goals of the project were:
<ol>
  <li>
    Generate CTP-readable templates based on the guidelines in  DICOM Working Group 18, Supplement 142.
  </li>
  <li>
    Create a release of CTP that will allow easy access to and management of these templates, and script files derived from these templates.
  </li>
</ol>

    December 2009 - &#34;option&#34; profiles completed by Justin Kirby

      <li>
        Note: These option profiles are overlays and do not modify any tags except what are explicitly listed in each option file.  It is highly recommended to start with the Basic Profile Script and then apply these option profiles afterwards to relax the de-identification scheme if desired.

    <ul>
      <li>
        S142 scripts updated based on final release of the supplement
      </li>
      <li>
        Still some minor issues relating to CTP support of S142 in its entirety including:
        <ul>
          <li>
            CTP does not currently have support for properly modifying contents of sequence tags. They can be removed or left alone, but contents cannot be replaced with dummy contents as instructed by some parts of S142. Until support is implemented in CTP the S142 based scripts will remove the tags completely instead of replacing with dummy values. (treat as &#34;X&#34; instead of &#34;D&#34;)
          </li>
          <li>
            On the option profiles which indicate one should “clean” the affected tags the current version of these scripts utilize the CTP function @keep() so that the tags are left alone. It is then up to individual users to implement the advanced regex style functions in CTP to “clean” any PHI found in these tags as appropriate.
          </li>
          <li>
            There are no profiles for Clean Pixel Data or Clean Recognizable Visual Features due to the need to visually inspect the images by hand to implement them.
          </li>
          <li>
            CTP does not currently provide a way to automatically populate (0012,0063) DeIdentificationMethod based on what profile options are implemented. One must manually enter the appropriate value for this tag based on which options are utilized. The @append function in CTP is recommended to avoid overwriting any earlier values stored, and the following format is suggested to avoid surpassing the allowable length for this element:
            <ul>
              <li>
                @append(){DCM:113100/113105/113107/113108/113109/113111}
              </li>
              <li>
                In this example it implies you have utilized S142&#39;s basic profile along with options for Clean Descriptors, Retain Longitudinal Temporal Information with Modified Dates, Retain Patient Characteristics, Retain Device Identity, and Retain Safe Private.
