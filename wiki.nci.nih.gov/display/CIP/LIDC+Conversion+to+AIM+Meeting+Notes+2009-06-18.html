Hi, Pat,

Attached please find the eap file for AIM model we used in CBIIT AIM data service in our development tier. You can see this is actually the 1.12 version plus some changes we discussed and you proposed for AIM 2.0.  We tried hard to avoid any deviation from the official model so we can upgrade to the official model easily once it comes out.

You can contact Jennifer to get a VPN account so you can access the AIM data service in CBIIT dev tier.  I have loaded all converted LIDC annotation files and all Annotation of Annotation files in this AIM data service. Once we get the official release of AIM 2.0, we will do a upgrade as soon as possible.

Let me if there is anything else I can do.

Thanks,

Qinyan Pan

Hi Jennifer &amp; John,

I&#39;m working on creating AIM data service plug-in for ClearCanvas. Currently, I am using AIM data service  at OSU (previously done by Tony and Ashish). I could get a simple interface connecting to that service  with the help from Marty Humphrey. The data service is at revision 9.

As for AIM 2.0, we will have a t-con with Dave and Daniel tomorrow. I hope to get them to agree with  what we currently have. Then, I will send the 2.0 model for comments for current AIM users next week.

Qinyan, could you give me your extensions to the AIM version 1 revision 12 (silver compatible) in a JPEG  format? I think that we include what you need for your work. But, I just want to be certain. If there are  additional needs, I will discuss with Dave and Daniel tomorrow.

It would be really nice if you could create AIM 2.0 data service for me to test with after I generate correct  XSD.

Thanks,

Pat

John, Pat,

Qinyan does set up one at CBIIT Dev environment.  But it is created base on the modified AIM model.  I am pretty sure not the same model Pat current has.

John is right about the firewall.  The Dev tier is inside NCI network.   You
do need a VPN account to access if you don&#39;t already have one.   I can send
Pat the application form for VPN.

I think the first thing to do is to synchronize the model.

Thanks,
Jennifer

Hi Pat - I agree the workspace needs an AIM data service set up for testing now, and hopefully actual production by end of this fiscal year.  I think NCI has one but there might be firewall issues that would limit access.

Jennifer/Qinyan - is there an AIM data service up now that&#39;s accessible to Northwestern?

THanks,
John

Hi John,

Do you have AIM data service available for me to test?

If so, could you give me the url to the data service?

Thanks,

Pat
