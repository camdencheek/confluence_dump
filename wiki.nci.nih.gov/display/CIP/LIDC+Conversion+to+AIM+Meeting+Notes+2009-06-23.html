LIDC AIM Telconv Notes

LIDC Call with additional participants

Pat Mongkolwat explained DICOM Segmentation Object:
Binary: is each voxel included - 0 or 1
Fractional: - two types -
1)         probability (%)
2)         occupancy (% of the voxel occupied by tumor)

LIDC PMAPS:
1.         No readers - score 0
2.         1 reader (out of four) = Â¼
3.         Denominator is number of readers who thought it was a nodule.(depends on number of readers)

How will we validate the AIM LIDC data?
Chuck - do analysis of the data... (not necessary to visualize) to test...
Tony Reeves - also could use the Cornell web tool.... (have all the public cases on their site)
QIWS testing:  UCLA or Chicago. (maybe Roger)

Action on PMAP -

Pat - AIM assumes a DICOM object...  w/o a DICOM segmentation object then it won&#39;t work.
Channin - can you create a DICOM representation of the pmap?
DICOM objects now exist for segmentation...

Proposed scenario:  In annotationofannotation, have the segmentation object associated with the annotation.
The pmap in xml gets converted to a dicom object... (by Qinyan Pan - we will have to ask her to assess the technical difficulty of this.
1)         find the appropriate DICOM supplement - to  see how much work is involved in converting a DICOM object from the pmaps...
DICOM segmentation objects may not be widely accepted yet...
.. but what are you going to do otherwise..we should add segmentation support to &#34;XIP&#34;workstation requirements

Still some questions about DICOM segmentation objects:
We should add the DICOM segmentation objects
DICOM part 3 p. 828 -  8.20   ...
Mike McN - is the LIDC meaning the same as &#34;only a proportion of that voxel
DICOM - does it mean, for example, 75% fat
Mathematically it works but do the semantics work?  We would need to make the semantics clear &#34;segmented property&#34;
Worse case:  submit a change proposal to DICOM to create 3rd type.

Imaging:Here is the DICOM specification document for DICOM segmentation objects.
