This week&#39;s meeting was canceled as there were no critical agenda items for discussion.  However here is a quick update of ongoing activities:
<ol>
  <li>
    Qinyan has completed a successful batch loading of the LIDC AIM formatted XML&#39;s into a test AIM data service
  </li>
  <li>
    Qinyan is now working on generation of P-Maps and the annotation of annotations
  </li>
  <li>
    We will begin to investigate options for the validation aspect of this project in the very near future which will require some way to visualize the AIM annotations and markups so that they can be compared to the output in the LIDC workstation (QIWS)
  </li>
  <li>
    Progress is also being made on the VASARI project.  TJU is in the process of submitting their images to NBIA as I write this email.  They have also provided us with the ID mappings required to match up the NBIA patient IDs to the characterizations generated by their radiologists so that we can begin converting the spreadsheet of annotations they provided us into AIM format. Janice Chili has begun entering the necessary new terms into the caDSR.
  </li>
