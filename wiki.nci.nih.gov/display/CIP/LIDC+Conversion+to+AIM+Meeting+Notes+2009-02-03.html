AIM Schema Generation:

First we curate UML in Enterprise Architect.

Generate xmi file

use caCORE 3.2.1 to generate XML schema for AIM

Then modify it by hand


Separately, we use EA to generate some C++ library (non-platform-specific), manually modify

THis C++ is a representation of an AIM object

use this code to generate DICOM SR, AIM XML documents

for each attribute we have a method, we have a set/get.


 Tony does not use the C++ library.  He uses the AIM Schema directly.


AIM Schema has two types:

1)
<a href="https://wiki.nci.nih.gov/download/attachments/12682065/AIM_v1_rv12_XML.xsd" rel="nofollow">
  Bi-directional Schema
</a>
(file name ends with &#34;model&#34;)

This is a superset of uni-directional

For example, when you translate these UML diagrams to an XML, you would be able to create an AIM object.  User, equipment can be root.

Why? Because it supports more queries such as &#34;Get the total number of RECIST markups that Reader One generated&#34;

This was requested by Baris Susek (the mentor)

  Uni-directional Schema
</a>
only &#34;image annotation&#34; and &#34;annotation annotation&#34; are roots.

The reason this one is still supported to generate AIM XML document

ImageZPosition

David Clunie and Larry Tarbox should be referenced for DICOM 3D implementation that will be referenced in AIM.

No reference implementation in AIM for 3D objects exists.

Does IPAD save markups in 3D?
