John,

I suggest you take a look at the terms I suggested adding to RadLex below.
Will these terms I propose work for you? In terms of encoding probably of malignancy, I&#39;ll ask Pat about whether there&#39;s a way to do that in AIM.

&gt;I agree with your comments.  &#34;Likelihood of malignancy&#34; sounds like a
&gt;more general version of BI-RADS, which has worked well in breast
&gt;imaging and I do think we will need in RadLex.  I expect that the
&gt;structured reporting groups focused on oncology will want to
&gt;incorporate something similar into their reports.

&gt; &gt; John,
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; I&#39;ve looked at your spreadsheet wrt incorporating LIDC terms into
&gt; &gt; Radlex.  I think we can accommodate nearly all the terms, but I&#39;d
&gt; &gt; suggest a few term naming changes to be consistent with other terms
&gt; &gt; in Radlex (Curt--pls look at my comments and I welcome hearing your
&gt; &gt; thoughts)
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; These terms which overlap with some of the LIDC terms are in radlex:
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Spiculated margin
&gt; &gt; Margin characteristic
&gt; &gt; Lobulated margin
&gt; &gt; Calcification
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; These LIDC terms are not in RadLex:
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Subtlety
&gt; &gt; Sphericity
&gt; &gt; Texture
&gt; &gt; Internal Structure
&gt; &gt; Likelihood of Malignancy
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; If &#34;subtlety&#34; refers to margin, we could add a term to radlex called
&gt; &gt; &#34;subtle margin&#34;
&gt; &gt; We can also add &#34;spherical&#34;, &#34;texture&#34; and &#34;internal substance&#34; to
&gt; &gt; radlex.
&gt; &gt;
&gt; &gt; Likelihood of malignancy doesn&#39;t seem to be appropriate for radlex.
&gt; &gt; Curt--did we have a similar term in radlex?
&gt; &gt;

&gt; &gt; &gt;1.        I&#39;ve attached an excel spreadsheet containing the caDSR
&gt; &gt; &gt;information for 9 terms from LIDC  we would like to be included in
&gt; &gt; &gt;RADLEX.  Please review and let me know if you need more information.
