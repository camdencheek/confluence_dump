  Meeting Minutes for LIDC to AIM 3.0 Conversion
</h1>
Date and Time: Apr. 28, 2010 1 pm to 3 pm

Location:    2115 E. Jefferson/6th Floor/Conference Room 6010

Attendees:      Freymann, John; Kirby, Justin;  Kascic, Eric; Mongkolwat, Pat; Pan, Qinyan


Agenda item:
1.    Discussed the mapping of ImageOberservation section. Pat came up with a different way to map the imageobservation and imageObservationCharacteristic. He suggested using &#34;Margin Scale&#34;, &#34;Subtlety Scale&#34;, &#34;Internal Structure Scale&#34; and etc. as the name of CharacteristicQuantification and move the codeMeaning of ImageOberservation down one level to ImageObservationCharacteristic element. For the codeMeaning of imageObservation, we can use &#34;nodule&#34;.

2.    Discussed the list of terminologies we need to submit to caDSR.  It was decided we are not using the term associating with permissible values of image characteristic as the codeMeaning of imageObservationCharacteristic, so there is no need for defining the missing terminologies for the permissible values.  Qinyan found two terms fit the need for describing annotation type in caDSR.  Therefore, we narrowed down the terms needed to be submitted to caDSR to only two, nodule and other.  John provided the definition and source of definition for nodule.  Pat provided BioPotrtal link for looking up the terms needed.

3.    Pat mentioned there are some changes needed for AIM 3.0.  He sent a new eap file for updated AIM3.0 model.  The xsd for AIM schema is going to be released by the early next week.

4.    Qinyan asked Pat the feedback of the mapped AIM annotation files she completed.  Pat stated everything looked fine except the ImageOberservation section. (see agenda item 1).

Action Item:
1.    Qinyan is going to remap the imageObservation section manually based on Pat&#39;s suggestion and sent it to Pat , John and Justin for review. Pat and Justin are going to forward the mapped annotation files to domain experts for review.
