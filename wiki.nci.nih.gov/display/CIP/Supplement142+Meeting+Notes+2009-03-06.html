These are Draft notes below - needs to be cleaned up!! - JBF


Profile:  Specified by DICOM 142

 Script:  Implementation of a Profile, or modification thereof

If you are editting a script


For example - if you created a private group, then applied the baseline DICOM142 profile to it - it would highlight the


CTP on startup it loads a configuration. Configuration specifies a script file.  In absence of script file, it loads a &#39;default&#39; script file.  From then on it uses that particular script file.


Suggestion:  Default script is based on the DICOM142 aggressive profile.


Levels of Script Instructions:

Replacement field of an element

Global Instructions:
<ol>
  <li>
    Global Keep
  </li>
  <li>
    Global Remove
  </li>
</ol>
Individual instructions (keeps, removes, and modification instructions) take precedence over Global Instructions (and keep takes precedence over remove)

Script file has 3 categories,


JP: New configurator will have a menu bar at the top with anonymizer instructions (so you would never have to edit the script file with a text editor)


If you have two anonymizer stages pointed at the same script file, modifications would be applied to both stages (not necessarily desirable)


&#34;Key&#34; management:

JP - a script attribute would point to a file that contains the key. Could be contained on a USB fob.

The way it works now every element can have its own key.  Not desirable.

Suggest the key should be a

Profiles are things defined by DICOM.

Justin list of issues:
Group 2  it&#39;s in &#39;file metadata&#39; , not in the main body
•    Date error - the CTP was trying to modify what it thought was a date but it was not valid

In the DICOM files
There is a DICOM tag designed to hold whether it is not deidentified.
Tag should add in the whole anonymization history...

Whow wrote supp 142:  David Clunie editor, Jay was a reviewer.  Others involved.  JP will ask

Group 12 is a DICOM standard group...
Jay- Within the clinical trial, when we manage it we keep the provinance in the group 12.
One at the acqui

Jay will send script for group 12
Jay will try to standardize and use the same scripting language...  John P has wanted to change the scripting language for some time...
