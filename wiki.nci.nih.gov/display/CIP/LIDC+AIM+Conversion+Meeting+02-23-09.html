Agenda/Notes:
<ul>
  <li>
    Qinyan demo&#39;d tool for converting LIDC to AIM
    <ul>
      <li>
        Notes on LIDC conversion process:
        <ul>
          <li>
            Run LIDC --&gt; AIM conversion against the NCIA downloaded XML
          </li>
          <li>
            Run MAX against the NCIA downloaded XML
          </li>
          <li>
            Run LIDC --&gt; AIM conversation against the MAX&#39;d XML to create annotation of annotation
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    Discussed significance of &#34;DateRequest&#34; and &#34;TimeRequest&#34; fields in original XML
    <ul>
      <li>
        convert this to something in AIM?Â  or just scrap it?
      </li>
      <li>
        Sam: there was also a &#34;DateService&#34; field but this is not in every XML
      </li>
      <li>
        the most important of any of this is the DateRequest - this is the time that the XML was completed by the LIDC group
      </li>
      <li>
        This information will be stored in the datetime element of the ? class (Qinyan will find out).
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    AIM requires a study date field
    <ul>
      <li>
        this information is not in the original XMLs
      </li>
      <li>
        since we don&#39;t have this information our options are to use an obviously false date or pull it from the dicom
      </li>
      <li>
        consensus on the call was to use a reference date
      </li>
      <li>
        if possible can we use a format like &#34;99-99-9999&#34; to satisfy the format but have it clearly show it&#39;s not a real date?
      </li>
      <li>
        Is the Study Date in the AIM annotation required to accurately represent the image with its annotation in an AIM-enabled browser like IPAD/Osirix or AIM-ClearCanvas?
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    Prioritization of remaining tasks
    <ul>
      <li>
        NCIA team has put together a tentative project plan
      </li>
      <li>
        John/Justin will review with Qinyan to help prioritize tasks and ensure plan makes sense
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    Validating the conversion upon completion
    <ul>
      <li>
        we could use some of these AIM compliant viewers to visualize the AIM and see if the markup is redrawn properly
      </li>
      <li>
        John mentioned the possibility of using Northwestern&#39;s ClearCanvas plugin once it&#39;s ready
      </li>
      <li>
        Mike mentioned we might even be able to do this with AVT - should coordinate with Bob Schwanke
      </li>
      <li>
        for validating the other information (not drawn marks) Sam has a lot of additional information about the cases in batch 1 that might help us confirm accuracy
      </li>
      <li>
        Mike said that visualizing side-by-side the original in QIWS and the AIM versions in an AIM-enabled browser would be necessary
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
