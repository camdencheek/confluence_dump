<ol>
  <li>
    Justin will continue to work through the table in supplement 142 to build a da.script that conforms as closely as possible to the &#34;Basic Profile&#34; outlined by working group 18
    <ol>
      <li>
        Justin will post updates

          on our wiki site
        </a>
        for anyone interested in seeing what the current status is.
      </li>
      <li>
         Upon completion Justin will setup another meeting to discuss questions and tags that are problematic for CTP
      </li>
    </ol>

  <li>
    JP will begin development efforts on CTP to prepare for integrating profiles when the scripts are completed.  This will include
    <ol>
      <li>
        Adding the ability to choose a pre-defined de-identification profile based on one of the supplement 142 profiles
      </li>
      <li>
        Adding the ability to tweak these profiles and save them as a user-defined profile for later use
      </li>
      <li>
        Potentially adding an increment time function, but we might just assume that when times are needed the user should employ a different profile that leaves them intact.  (Increment time may be a requirement of Supplement142 in some cases)
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>
    Jay agreed to let Justin contact him with questions regarding implementation of the supplement rules
  </li>
  <li>
    JP will investigate additional new development suggestions
    <ol>
      <li>
         Adding a feature to allow storage of all dicom tags into a client-side database so they can be easily used to update/append to the de-identified data if it is found that this information is needed after the original submission
      </li>
      <li>
        Creating an &#34;explorer&#34; type of view for the pipeline configuration page (to help accommodate CTP&#39;s using a large number of pipelines)
      </li>
    </ol>
