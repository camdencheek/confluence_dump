        Summary of requirement pre-interview, by Reviewer:
      </td>
      <td>
        caDSR tools should support downloading objects, (CDE, DEC, VD and PV) from accross the set of caDSR toolset or any one particular tool. The request is a top priority that will enable curators and users to select objects from a search list whether it be in CDE browser or Curation tool and be able to download it using the Object Cart.

        The request for a customizable download will need to be supported by each tool and enhancements will need to be made to the UML Model Browser as no object cart functionality exists today for this tool. Similar enhancements will need to be made for the Content Curation Tool.

        Detailed Use Cases for Customized Download can be found at the following link:
