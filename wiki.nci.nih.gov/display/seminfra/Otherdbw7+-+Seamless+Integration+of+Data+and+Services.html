        Summary of requirement pre-interview, by Reviewer:
      </td>
      <td>
        Application developers need to be able to easily use the infrastructure to create workflows without having to figure out how to integrate the data or services, the infrastructure should step them through it and just ask for things that are not already available - need to be able to reuse stored Platform Independent Models (PIMs) to create Platform Specific Models (PSM) - almost transparent to the end user (application developers) - the metadata should be compared and possible integration points served up.
        Ideally, the workflow authoring tool would lead the user through steps to fit data to the service, or services together at different levels (1,2,3,4) where the output from one level can be used as input to another level - such as a pre-processing step that is needed before inputting the data to another service.  Alternatively, the system could serve up data sources that can be used with a particular service, and note the services that might be interesting to run before or after the one you are looking at.  The system shoudl be able to find and reuse appropriate transformation services, and save the workflow for use/resue by the author or others.

        Everything needed to use the application should be available from the download, like Scratch from MIT scratch.mit.edu (good example): Click through setup, instructions, release notes, faqs, links to support desk.
        caIntegrator is a project that will help SI team understand the use cases.
