        Summary of requirement pre-interview, by Reviewer:
      </td>
      <td>
        Using Natural Language Processing and integrating both EVS and caDSR APIs or similar future services, create a discovery service/tool which exposes data elements not based on the Names stored in caDSR but by using query in a concept search and pulling associated Administered Components from caDSR to match. This would enable construction of better search algorithms and serve as a potentially better discovery entry point for the user not familiar with the ISO 11179 nomenclature.  The primary users that this would serve include both Cancer Researchers and Information Technologists.
