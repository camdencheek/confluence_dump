        Business ;goal: To allow creation of conformance profiles that standardardize semantic and functional descriptions for services

        Actor: Information Technologist

        An information specialist would like to create/register a new conformance profile using an editor.  The editor interacts with a conformance profile registry or repository that stores conformance profiles.
        The editor should guide developers to be able to develop well-formed conformance profiles. The editor should allow development of new conformance profiles from existing ones (e.g. copy an existing profile and extend).
        The editor should be able to register a conformance profile in the registry/repository.
