The VCDE initial project is active from November 2009 - Feb 14, 2010

  Problem Statement
</h3>
There will be work beginning in 2010 to build infrastructure (software). VCDE WS has resources to use for &#34;Requirements elicitation in the community&#34; that would help jump start the development early next year. This will be done in concert with the Vocabulary Knowledge Center. This effort should be seen as an ongoing activity by VCDE WS in 2010 and should support the overall &#34;Software development processes&#34; for caBIG® in 2010 and beyond.
<h3 id="VCDERequirementsElicitationTeamCharter2009-Objectives">
  Objectives
</h3>
This exercise would do at least three things:
<ul>
  <li>
    Access whether initiatives are addressing community needs
  </li>
  <li>
    Provide traceability from grass roots community needs to more top level initiatives in ConOps
  </li>
  <li>
    Provide input into ConOps to address further community needs
  </li>
</ul>

  Process
</h2>
The process the analysts are following is:

1) Review Vocabulary Knowledge Center (VKC) Forum postings and organize by Semantic Infrastructure (SI) Concept Of Operations Initiatives (from the caBIG® community at large, which we want to encourage). Refer to the assignments under VKC SI Initiatives on the
<a href="https://wiki.nci.nih.gov/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=63996252" rel="nofollow">
  Semantic Infrastructure Concept of Operations Initiatives - Requirements Master List
</a>
.

2) Complete Script/Template (pre-interview) for each forum topic - assign Requirements Unique ID, the goal is to develop a Formal Requirement Statement and, if time a Use Case Summary, and/or Detail Use Case Scenarios for each forum entry.

</a>
(you must be logged in to create a new page).

3) Determine next step(s) to refine the requirement, which may be an interview in order to create a Formal Requirements Statement or it may be ready for development of detailed use case in text or diagram form, or it may simply be a non-functional requirement or design constraint.

4) For functional requirements, analysts will create very formal use cases and requirements (by Business Analysts) - assign Use Case(s) unique IDs and link/tie to Requirement Questionnaire by Unique ID - if there isn&#39;t a requirements questionnaire completed already, create one and link it to an initiative if it fits into an existing category, or to the VKC Master List &#34;Other&#34;.

5)  Build validation plans for new infrastructure components including ensuring ECCF artifacts and reviews.
