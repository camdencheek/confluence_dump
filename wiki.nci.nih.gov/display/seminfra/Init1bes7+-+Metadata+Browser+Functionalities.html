        Actor: Information Specialist
        Business Goal: To find/discover reusable metadata from knowledge/model repositories
        An information specialist uses  metadata browser (knowledge or model)  that will return search results in a customizable table where user will be able to choose what components of metadata (e.g. DEC concepts and Value domains for CDEs, class names, datatypes) to display.

        Hello, my name is NAME. I am calling you today because NCI and caBIG are working toward a new and improved version of the semantic infrastructure to better support integration scenarios.   Our first step was to organize requirements collected over the past year. Your organization has expressed a requirement/need for BRIEF STATEMENT OF USER REQUIREMENT.  This has been identified as potentially a critical component to support application/data and service integration, and we need more information in order to enable us to meet this requirement.  Do you have about 30 minutes to talk about this?
      </td>
      <td>
        Yes.

        Do you have any solution integration needs? If so, what are they? Have you envisioned new ways of interacting with existing or new parts of the semantic  infrastructure?
        (prompt to elicit changes/new ways of using the infrastructure)
      </td>
      <td>
        Information specialist invokes a search/query using a metadata browser that interacts with knowledge or model repository). In return metadata browser returns a default table with the best hits. Information specialist should be able to customize the columns that will be presented in the search results (e.g. showing value domains, permissible values, superclasses, semantic annotations).

        Yes. Browsers, SIW, Curation Tool, Admin Tool

        Not user friendly. Too many tools serving similar purposes. Certain functionalities are only available in some so you need to know all for effective use. Most functionalites can be combined under one tool.  Rigid/static result pages.
