        a model is being loaded into caDSR containing enumerations for an attribute in the model.  The Uml loader needs to create a new value domain in caDSR, or reuse a Value Domain, with the correct Permissible Value Set associated with it.   The concepts associated with a UML Attribute are referred to as the &#34;mapped concepts&#34;, the concepts associated with caDSR items are called &#34;concept derivation rule&#34;

        1. Using the UML attribute Primary mapped concept  search caDSR for matching Concept = PreferredName  2. Using Matching Concept, get Concept.ComponentConceptCollection   3. for the conceptCollection with Primary Flag = &#34;Yes&#34; get its Derivation Rule.  This indicates that the concept in the collection is the one where the matching concept is the &#34;primary&#34; concept for its associated components   4. for the Derivation Rule, get its ValueMeaningCollection   5. for each valueMeaning get the conceptDerivationrule and check to see if the mapped concepts match the concept derivation rule for the valueMeaning (checking qualifiers and their order). this is accomplished by getting the ConceptDerivationRule.componentConceptCollection and checking &#34;display Order&#34; against the order of the UML attribute mapped concepts.   6. if the concept derivation rule and mapped concepts match, then the UML Attribute and the ValueMeaning are semantically equivalent.    7. Get the ValueMeaning--&gt;PermissibleValueCollection  8. Get the PermissibleValue--&gt;ValueDomainPermissibleValueCollection.  9. Get the ValueDomainPermissibleValue --&gt; EnumeratedValueDomain  10. Get the enumeratedValueDomain --&gt; ValueDomainPermissibleValueCollection  you will now have the set of PermissibleValues that are associated with this particular ValueDomain containing the Matching ValueMeaning.  11. For each instance of the EnumeratedValueDomain. ValueDomainPermissibleValue get the PermissibleValue and compare the PermissibleValue.value with the UML Attribute name  9. If the UML Attribute Name matches the PermissibleValue.Value, then loader can potentially reuse the existing value meaning in caDSR as the semantic basis for the UML attribute in the model.    8. the loader continues this process for each UML Attribute in the Local Value Domain class using the EnumeratedValueDomain.  Only if the entire et of UML Attributes&#39; mapped concepts match the PermissibleValue Set, and to those PermissibleValue.Value names, then can the associated Enumerated VD we reused.   9. if the set does not match the first EnumeratedValueDomain, Repeat this process for all EnumeratedValueDomains found to be associated with this ValueManing.  10. Otherwise, Loader should reuse the individual ValueMeanings that matched, and create a New VD based on the full set in the Local Value Domain Class.
