        Summary of requirement pre-interview, by Reviewer:
      </td>
      <td>
        Domain analysis models play a central role in providing a common framework for implementation models. Within the life sciences domain a first pass domain analysis model called the LSDAM is being produced. Ultimately this model will need to be revised and refined so that it can play a role in the life sciences domain analogous to the role played by the BRIDG model in the clinical trial space. The architectural and semantics expectations regarding future development of this model will play a role in driving refinement, however the functional and structural requirements of the life sciences domain must drive the evolution of the model and the tactics that are defined for its use.  DAMs are authored by Information Modelers, overseen by Metadata Curators, and reused by Information Modelers and Software Engineers.
        //
        The issues with the current infrastructure and business practices are that the required domain models typically only hold the classes, attributes, associations, some models contain enumerations, but not all. And no other constraints on submitting formalized behaviors.
        In order to localize, or constrain a DAM, such as BRIDG, a developer needs to understand the rules that apply to the model, and what is allowed to be changed.  Can the value domain be changed? can a different code list be used? etc.  One example was around activity classes in BRIDG when trying to develop COPPA. &#34;They were very complicated and we didn&#39;t know (without talking to the developer or seeing the data)  if they were complete or not complete (e.g., specific enough or too general or wrong or ambiguous, semantically)&#34;  WE need to understand more about this requirement in order to develop a use case.

              <li>
                Design constraint: impose restrictions on how the product must be designed, such as conformant to ISO 11179, utilizes 21090 or is able to work on a particular type of device
