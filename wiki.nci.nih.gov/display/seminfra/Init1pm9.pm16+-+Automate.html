        There is a need to be able to import electronic documents/forms into the caDSR.  These may be electronically computable (e.g. in a well formed spreadsheet or other file) or simply a print form (e.g. PDF).  Either way, they need to be annotated as &#34;models&#34; or &#34;forms&#34; within the metadata repository.
