Semantic Infrastructure Domain User Story 5:
Support the addition of data elements to an existing information model and automatically capture and publish the information about the extensions.
<h2 id="SemanticInfrastructureDomainUserStory5-DomainDescription">
  Domain Description
</h2>
A teratoma is an encapsulated tumor with tissue or organ components resembling normal derivatives of all three germ layers. Regardless of location in the body, a teratoma is classified according to a cancer staging system: 0 or mature (benign); 1 or immature, probably benign; 2 or immature, possibly malignant (cancerous); and 3 or frankly malignant. Teratomas are also classified by their content: a solid teratoma contains only tissues (perhaps including more complex structures); a cystic teratoma contain only pockets of fluid or semi-fluid such as cerebrospinal fluid, sebum, or fat; a mixed teratoma contains both solid and cystic parts. A cancer researcher would like to extend the pathology annotations associated with tissues in the center&#39;s tissue bank by adding Teratoma Content as an additional nonseminomatous germ cell tumor (NSGCT) annotation. The researcher communicates this to the director of the tissue repository, who promptly opens the administrative interface to caTissue and adds the additional pathology annotation. The system is now able to capture this, and the data and data descriptions are shareable with other organizations.

  Technical Description
</h2>
The cancer center is running caTissue with a local metadata repository. When a new annotation is added to caTissue, the dynamic extensions module is invoked. The caTissue information model is extended to include necessary additional classes and attributes, which in turn are propagated as new data elements in the metadata repository. These data elements represent well formed metadata that is automatically discoverable and shareable through the public interfaces. When another organization wishes to extend their caTissue model to include this type of data, they will be able to discover the metadata already created and instantiate a reference to it rather than creating it afresh.
