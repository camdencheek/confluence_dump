      </td>
      <td>
        The Actor is a Cancer researcher purely from a domain side wanting to get acquainted with various caBIG tools models.

        Business goal is to make documentation supporting the model as informative as possible to a layman.

        Requirement:
        1)When submitting a new model or modifying an existing one it should be accompanied with a document/s which, in a very easy to understand language explain the purpose, utility, constraints, the relationships, instructions to use, future scope and path and outlook for each of the models;

        2) There needs to be a crystallized definition of each model type (Domain Model, Domain Object Model, Domain Information Model, Domain Analysis Model, Business Architecture Model) how they are created and how they relate to one another

        3) There needs to be traceability of individual specifications /requirements throughout the design/specification/modeling process: starting from abstract (implicit or explicit)requirements formulation to the concrete implementation.

        4) More clarity is needed on the question of UML versus OWL as
         choice for the formal model representation
