        In some cases, two semantically equivalent data element can be annotated with different semantic concepts that may or may not themselves be related.  In these cases, there needs to be a mechanism to define semantic equivalence between the data elements, the concepts, or expand/contract the scope of the semantic query in the case of related concepts.  An example of this use case is that there needs to be a way to discover data elements both with StartDate and Begin+Date, e.g. through a semantic equivalence of the two or through a widening/narrowing query.
