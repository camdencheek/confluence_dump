        Summary of requirement pre-interview, by Reviewer:
      </td>
      <td>
        Business Goal: Develop tools that will help modelers to easily identify reusable components of registered models
        Actor: Information Technologist (Modelers)
        Browsing tool(s) that will allow to visualize and navigate the whole model loaded in Knowledge/Model Repository. Unlike textual representations, currently supported by the UML Model Browser, the tool should provide &#34;graphical&#34; representations.  This would enhance a potential new users ability to determine if they can use all or parts of a model.

        Waiting room
        This require.ment overlaps with an existing requirements posted and later detailed by Tejas Dave in an interview (
        <a href="https://wiki.nci.nih.gov/x/NhBlAQ" rel="nofollow">
          see &#34;Presentation of search results&#34; in response to Q11
        </a>
        ).
        Hence, the suggested next step is to wait to leverage(use) the use case that will be developed for the requirement above.
