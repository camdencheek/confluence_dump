The following suggestions provide some guidance for structuring the existing inventory of use cases using the ODP community concepts:
<ol>
  <li>
    Adopt use case levelling to organize use cases in categories and relate these categories to each other; a side effect of this is that re-usable sequences can be identified, thus removing duplication and promoting reuse of both requirements and solution approaches.
  </li>
  <li>
    Map the levelled use cases to the respective community models; note that this is inevitably a human activity, guided by rules defined in
    <a href="https://wiki.nci.nih.gov/x/Mg-DAQ#3.1-UseCaseLevelingApproach-table311" rel="nofollow">
      Table 3.1-1
    </a>
    . This table can also be used when analysing narrative text of use cases to identify interactions between the User and the System role.
  </li>
  <li>
    Analyse the actions and interactions associated with system roles in the community and map them to appropriate candidate Enterprise Services.
  </li>
  <li>
    Analyse whether there are possible sub-communities and/or relationships with other communities.
  </li>
</ol>
