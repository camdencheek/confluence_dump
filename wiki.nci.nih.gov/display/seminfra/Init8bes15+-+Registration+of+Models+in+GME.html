        Actor: Information Technologist (more specifically software engineer)
        Business goal: To main interoperability between services utilizing the same data/information model in different implementation-specific representations. To provide developers alternative consistent data/information model representations to best suit their implementation needs.
        Motivation:
        Information Technologist would like to be able to find implementation-specific formats/representations such as XML schemas for the data/information models. For instance XML schemas can be used by caGrid service authoring tools for defining inputs and outputs of a caGrid service to maintain consistency and interoperability between different caGrid services utilizing the same data model, authoritative XML schema for each data model should be tracked (alternatively, authoritative mapping rules from UML to XSD should be defined and enforced)
        Requirement:
        A repository (or multiple) should exist to support authoritative representations of the model for that architecture implementation. If multiple repositories involved, then the consistency/correspondence between these model representations should be guaranteed through tooling (e.g. watchdogs) and/or processes (e.g. concurrent registration from single point).

        A browser should exist that will allow Information Specialist (developer) searching (discovering) and retrieval of corresponding model representations from single or multiple repositories. |

        Observe - Currently GME is part of caGrid. Depending on how knowledge repositories will shape this can either become a requirement for the repositories in semantic infrastructure con-op document or may be a requirement for architecture.
