        A user should be able to select a collection of metadata &#34;things&#34; - forms, CDEs, etc. that are named and have privileges.  There are some in global scope (managed by a certain few people), a user can create any number of them, and that user can make his publicly available (say, give me John&#39;s public collections, then give me John&#39;s Breast Stdy 123 collection).  There would be a service (API) with these types of functions.
