  Meeting Minutes
</h2>
1. Last week for RAs (Bea 10 min)
Request to Hua and Baris to send any &#34;lessons learned&#34; to Bea and Denise
Hua and Baris, please forward any emails exchanges that need to be followed up by incoming team
Baris has 2 interviews lined up and will set up one more with Rakesh. Baris would like to wrap those up and that may run into next week.
Bea will check with Brian to make sure that&#39;s ok.
Hua also has another interview.

Everyone, please send hours for month of January to Bea by end of month

2. Update/Questions/Concerns from each RA/BA (20 minutes - about 5 minutes each)

Shantanu:
<ul>
  <li>
    question regarding naming convention of use cases
  </li>
  <li>
    Suggestion: Do we need another row in use case template: Assumptions? Denise says this might be too similar to precondition and would be diverging from other use case templates. For now assumptions can be written into pre-conditions. Denise  asks Shantanu to send her a write-up of the difference of assumption and pre-condition, so that she can reflect on it.
  </li>
</ul>
Baris:
update on Sal, John and Paul, question regarding Dynamic CDE Browser Topic discussed and resolved by Denise.
Add to summary:&#34;use cases could be:...list&#34;

Hua:
update on her remaining topics.

Mohamed:
Mohamed has not received login to wikis yet.
contacted 3 submitters for more detail on use cases by email.
ontology and NCI level vocabulary need to be Initiative 5, not 1
first use case submitted in form of word file to Bea. Bea will forward to Denise to review.

3.  Feedback on use case template / naming convention / separating use cases to have on per screen (30 minutes)

The new naming convention will include the initials for both, the requirement analyst (questionnaire) AND the business analyst (use case).

I.e. if Baris did the questionaire and Patrick did the use case the name would be:

Init1bes4.PM1
&lt;SemCon Ops Initiative&gt;&lt;requirement analyst&#39;s initials&gt;&lt;requirement number&gt;.&lt;business analyst&#39;s initials&gt; &lt;use case number&gt;,
