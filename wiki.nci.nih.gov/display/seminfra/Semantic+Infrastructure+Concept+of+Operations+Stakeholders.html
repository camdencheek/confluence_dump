  Stakeholders Overview
</h2>
The caBIG® Semantic Infrastructure will operate within a broad stakeholder community consisting of representatives of all of the professions and services involved in medical research and clinical care.

Primary stakeholders of the caBIG® Semantic Infrastructure include caBIG® and BIG Health, federal and international semantic content development partners (notably FDA and CDISC), developers and users of the caEMR, and software vendors that rely on the ECCF artifacts to develop offerings compatible with caBIG® specifications. It is anticipated that many of these stakeholders will not leverage our implementations, but rather will provide independently developed implementation that will interoperate with caBIG® or caGrid.

Some stakeholders are direct or indirect end users of the terminologies (EVS) and the registered metadata (MDRs).
<h2 id="SemanticInfrastructureConceptofOperationsStakeholders-DirectUsers">
  Direct Users
</h2>
Direct end users of the semantic infrastructure are those who would leverage the terminology or metadata programmatically to build metadata driven software, for designing data services or for electronic data collection applications from the registered metadata. Others might use the user interfaces to look up the meaning of terminology when writing research papers, annotating instance data, or annotating metamodels for registration to be used in future software development, discovery and data/information mining services, data items found on forms, in applications or data repositories developed by the community.
<h2 id="SemanticInfrastructureConceptofOperationsStakeholders-IndirectUsers">
  Indirect Users
</h2>
Indirect users are those using the software applications that have been developed on top of the semantic infrastructure such as an application to discover related data or analytic services, an online data collection application in which the reference documentation registered alongside the metadata item and made available by the application as on-line &#34;Help&#34; such as instructions or standard documentation. Other indirect users may use software written to leverage the semantic infrastructure to discover new or hidden relationships in the data.
<h2 id="SemanticInfrastructureConceptofOperationsStakeholders-PrimaryUsers">
  Primary Users
</h2>
The primary direct and indirect end users include:
<ul>
  <li>
    Software and Application designers and architects
  </li>
  <li>
    Software and Application engineers and developers
  </li>
  <li>
    Scientific and medical researchers

  Stakeholders in New Semantic Infrastructure
</h2>
The key to success for the next generation infrastructure is defining the critical, unmet usage scenarios of parties interested in leveraging this infrastructure.  Interested parties are encouraged to become involved over the next few months as we attempt to characterize in more detail the requirements to achieve the interoperability vision.
