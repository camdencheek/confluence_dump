      </td>
      <td>
        Business goal: Ability to develop forms with persistence layers
        Actor: Metadata Specialist (Form Author)
        A metadata specialist will use a dynamic form develoment tool that allows the form designer to interact with the MDR /Models/Rules repository to  create new forms that are compatible with existing content.

        This requirement includes the following 4 use cases:
        (1) collection of standardized data utilizing reusable data elements
        (2) defining the form structure
        (3) defining the form behavior
        (4) generating the data persistence models to support the form.

        The tool should interact with a repository (or multiple repositories) that stores:

        - Data Element-centric metadata including the abstract concept (CDE) with its associated value domain (e.g. in Knowledge Repository). Data elements should be able to be used regardless of their source (a form based CDE or model based CDE that became available through model load to Knowledge Repository).

        - Form metadata including the definition of the form structure including sections, order and their relationships. And also the form behavior including value set constraints, skip logic, repetition and optionality

        - Persistence metadata including the contextually defined and constrained instance of use of an abstract concept in a data persistence model,  and the binding of form structural elements to persistence model elements in a given context of use
