        Summary of requirement pre-interview, by Reviewer:
      </td>
      <td>
        Dynamic extensions are used to dynamically add additional data elements to an information model that is already underlying an application.  It is highly desirable that these new data elements are publishable to the metadata repository in a dynamic way that does not require much manual information (e.g. UML modeling) from the application owner.

        Hello, my name is NAME. I am calling you today because NCI and caBIG are working toward a new and improved version of the semantic infrastructure to better support integration scenarios.   Our first step was to organize requirements collected over the past year. Your organization has expressed a requirement/need for BRIEF STATEMENT OF USER REQUIREMENT.  This has been identified as potentially a critical component to support application/data and service integration, and we need more information in order to enable us to meet this requirement.  Do you have about 30 minutes to talk about this?
      </td>
      <td>
        Yes.

        Do you have any solution integration needs? If so, what are they? Have you envisioned new ways of interacting with existing or new parts of the semantic  infrastructure?
        (prompt to elicit changes/new ways of using the infrastructure)
      </td>
      <td>
        The possible solutions for the dynamic extension are as follows:
        <ul>
          <li>
            Create the federated metadata repository (e.g., allow user to create new data elements, attributes
          </li>
          <li>
            Create the federated terminology services (e.g., allow user to create new terms or add its own definitions)
          </li>
          <li>
            Browsers to query the federated metadata repository and terminology on the Grid
          </li>
          <li>
            Tools to semantic annotate data using concepts, attributes, CDEs created through dynamic extension

            better support metadata search across federated metadata repositories on the grid (e.g., find data elements created by others)
          </li>
          <li>
