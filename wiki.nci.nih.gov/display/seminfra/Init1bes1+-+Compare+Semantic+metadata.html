        Business Goal: To improve metadata reuse
        Actor: Information Specialist (Modeler)
        A modeler uses a model repository browser that allows comparisons of different models (complete or partial). Or a modeler uses  a Knowledge Repository Browser  that provides ability to compare various levels of semantic metadata such as data elements, object classes, value domains, concepts is needed.

        Hello, my name is NAME. I am calling you today because NCI and caBIG are working toward a new and improved version of the semantic infrastructure to better support integration scenarios.   Our first step was to organize requirements collected over the past year. Your organization has expressed a requirement/need for BRIEF STATEMENT OF USER REQUIREMENT.  This has been identified as potentially a critical component to support application/data and service integration, and we need more information in order to enable us to meet this requirement.  Do you have about 30 minutes to talk about this?

      </td>
      <td>

        We need browsers that interact with and search Knowledge and Model Repositories and support:
        <ul>
          <li>
            Comparison of selected search results: The comparison functionality should allow:
            -Side-by-side comparison of the metadata/model components
            -Graphical (with visual clues such as coloring common attributes mapped to same DEC and/or CDE, classes sharing the same object classes) and textual representation (with visual clues such as similarities colored the same way)
            -Extension of the list compared by new components  thorugh additional searches
            -[VCDE:For model view] Even if not selected, seeing generalization of selected classes (inherited subclasses)
            -[VCDE:For model view]  Uploading (or removal) of an annotated model that is under development, to be able to compare with selected classes
            -[VCDE:For model components] Selecting some of the compared items, adding to a shopping cart (basket) that can be exported in XMI (if needed transformed to classes for modeling tool consumption) and XML compliant with ISO 11179 XSD.

        Focusing more to developing browsers for modelers/developers as a consumer base given the requirements above is for improving metadata reuse and primarily ask for:
        - Better support for modeling tools and the input formats to support modelers
        - Better search, visulization functionalities to improve model-level reuse

        This will improve reuse of metadata. The negative impact would be poor (if not none) reuse and (unintended) redundant metadata.

        If, for any reason, we were not able to create that solution, do you think there might be another way to solve this issue? Can you think of an alternative solution?
        (prompt to elicit alternative solutions/workarounds)
        (to be prepared by the Requirement Analyst)
      </td>
      <td>
        One alternative solution, other then those involve more manual work for developers/modelers, will be facilitating direct interaction of modeling tools with model or knowledge repository, allowing all metadata to be pulled to modeling tool and allowing developer/modeler to handle comparison/filtering/elimination of model components at the modeling tool level. One downside is, since modeling tools are not necessarily developed to support comparison (or help for doing so), the user may fail to identify the right model component he would choose otherwise.

        The browsers that interact with Knowledge and Model Repositories should also support below as a complementary to the main requirement described above:
        <ul>
          <li>
            Selection/configuration of repository instances to use: In a federated environment, user should be able to choose/configure which model and/or knowledge repository instances s/he wants to use.
          </li>
          <li>
            Search and discovery:  The browsers should allow developers/modeler to be able to discover/search the model or metadata components. The searches can be against:
            -Project names
            -Model package names
            -Description of model components (classes/attributes)
            -Semantic annotation (concepts)
            -Value domains/permissible values
            -Any text field that is provided for the model or associated metadata (free text search)
          </li>
          <li>
            Presentation of search results: The search results should:
             -Use color coding that makes them easy to read
            -Provide both textual (tabular) and graphical representation which can be selected per user&#39;s preference. Graphical representation is especially useful for visualizing Models and/or Model components.
            -Provide capacity to easily switch between model-centric or semantic metadata centric views. This should be supported for both graphical or textual representations.
            -Allow customization of the format, order and content (headings) of returned results.  For instance user should be able to drop/add fields to from textual representation.
            -Rank results with different fields/attributes as requested. The default ranking should consider the level of &#34;reuse&#34; for any given component (DE, object class, VD, class name) to allow users to identify highly reused components easier.
            -Allow selection of the search results (partial or complete) for comparison
            -Allow selection of the search results (partial or complete) to be added in a shopping cart (basket). User should be able to export the shopping cart in XMI (if needed transformed to classes for modeling tool consumption) and an XML document compliant with ISO 11179 XSD.

          <li>
            In the comparison view, I should be able to upload my model (in a format produced by my modeling tool) and immediately see the common classes/attributes with respect to other model component that is already in the comparison view
          </li>
          <li>
            In the comparison view, I should be able to add more than one model (under development) to visualize common points betwen my and other models

          <li>
            In the comparison view, I should be able to see the common classes and/or attributes (based on annotations)
            From results view and/or comparison view, I should be able to export selected classes (or CDEs) and export them (or translated versions if CDE) in XMI format to be able to import back to EA tool
