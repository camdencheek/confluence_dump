  Introduction
</h2>
An important part of the requirements gathering process is to engage end users and stakeholders.  In an infrastructure project of this nature, a good way to relay the types of functionality that will be supported is through user stories. This list is not meant to be exhaustive.  These stories are representative of the types of functionality that will be directly supported by the infrastructure, as well as the types of tooling that will be enabled by the infrastructure.
