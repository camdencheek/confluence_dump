Semantic Infrastructure Domain User Story 6:  Discover and orchestrate services to achieve LS research goals; e.g. start with a hypothesis, identify relevant services that provides the necessary analysis and data, create the worklow/pipeline, report findings.

  Domain Description Revised From ICRi Use Cases
</h2>
A scientist is trying to identify a new genetic biomarker for HER2/neu negative stage I breast cancer patients. The scientist queries for HER2/neu negative tissue specimens of Stage I breast cancer patients using services at his/her cancer center that also have corresponding microarray experiments. Analysis of the microarray experiments identify genes that are significantly over-expressed and under-expressed in a number of cases. The scientist decides that these results are significant, and related literature suggest a hypothesis that gene A may serve as a biomarker in HER2/neu negative Stage I breast cancer. To validate this hypothesis in a significant number of cases the scientist needs a larger data set, so he queries for all the HER2/neu negative specimens of Stage I breast cancer patients with corresponding microarray data and also for appropriate control data from other cancer centers. After retrieving the microarray experiments the scientist analyzes the data for over-expression of genes A.

  Technical Description
</h2>
The scientist in this case is trying to develop a workflow that will assist biomarker discovery research. S/he first needs to discover the services that provide biospecimen information with the phenotype s/he is looking for (e.g. HER2/neu negative stage I breast cancer) and then the microarray experiment information. Then he needs to create a workflow (orchestrate services) where the input is a phenotype for biospecimens and output is a set of gene of interest. These steps require the support for standard terminologies (and services) and syntaxes to best describe the services&#39; behavior and static data. Furthermore they require inference engines that relates the semantic and syntactic metadata for the inputs/outputs of the services to &#34;assist&#34; scientist to identify what service can be part of the workflow.
