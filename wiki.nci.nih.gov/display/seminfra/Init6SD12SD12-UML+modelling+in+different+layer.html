      <td>
        One persons object is another person&#39;s attribute&#34;. Depending on ones world view, a real life entity can be modeled in UML as Object, Attribute or value set. In caBIG models now, some model Race (and Ethnicity) as an Object while others model Race (and Etnicty ) as an attribute. This is problematic, because Race data that is modeled differently cannot be &#34;seamlessly integrated&#34; on caGrid (there needs to be a transform).
        The evolution of technologies is disruptive and caBIG to really support seamless datasharing experience  needs to evolve beyond interoperability based on CDEs, primarily. It not only needs to support the grid platform but also the mobile, .NET WSDL platform. NCI with its CIMs, PIMs  PSMs, BAM and DAM needs to interoperate with whatever CIMs, PIMs  PSMs, BAM and DAM that they might have.
