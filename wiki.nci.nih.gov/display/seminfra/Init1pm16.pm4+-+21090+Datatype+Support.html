        ISO 21090 defines a set of datatypes for reuse within healthcare applications.  When developing a new information model for sharing healthcare data, the first step is to choose a set of datatypes to &#34;import&#34; or &#34;derive from&#34;.  Being able to select which datatypes you will reuse forms the basis of interoperating at the basic (datatype) level.

        An alternate flow to this use case is that the Information Modeler imports datatypes from another information model (which may be localized rather than the vanilla ISO 21090 datatypes).  This is a highly desirable flow because it will greatly speed the adoption of ISO 21090 datatypes and interoperability.

      <td>
        A key aspect of ISO 21090 datatypes is that they can be localized for use within a specific information model.  The datatypes themselves define a number of optional attributes and associations, and the actual behavior of the datatypes in some cases can be modified.  Specifically, ISO 21090 has two types of conformance: Direct Conformance and Indirect Conformance.  Indirect conformance is defined as:
        <ul>
          <li>
            Provide mappings between internal datatypes and the healthcare datatypes
          </li>
          <li>
            Specify for which of the datatypes an inward mapping is provided, for which an outward mapping is provided, and for which no mapping is providedThis use case describes the steps that an Information Modeler takes to localize the datatypes in alignment of Indirect Conformance.

        The steps above do not preclude the creation of ECCF documents or other mappings/specification documents.  However, this use case does ease the creation of such documents because the ISO 21090 datatypes are derived directly from the metadata repository (meaning they have the appropriate level of specification/documentation already) and the localizations are made in conformance with the metadata repository conventions.

        The datatatypes should be localized using the conventions of the UML modeling tool.  That is, it is highly desirable that user actions be constrained by what will be conformant when the localized datatypes are registered and shared.
        It is absolutely critical that the resulting localized datatypes be in conformance with the conformance metrics defined in the ISO 21090 specification.

      <td>
        ISO 21090 data types have a specific encoding scheme that is significantly different than what has been used thus far in caBIG services.  Rather than reengineering existing services entirely, it may be desirable to have a common translation service interface and implementation toolkit that can be used to &#34;wrap&#34; existing non-compliant services.
