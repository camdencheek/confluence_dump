        Summary of requirement pre-interview, by Reviewer:
      </td>
      <td>
        NCI has stated to CDISC is that if they submit their requirements to us during our build, they would be incorporated as our requirements. With the caveats that:
        -        all requirements cannot be met in the first iteration, it will be a process  -        due to the distributable nature of what we plan to build, we made no assumptions about hosting   -      there could be one to many terminology servers and repositories serving NCI, CDISC or others
