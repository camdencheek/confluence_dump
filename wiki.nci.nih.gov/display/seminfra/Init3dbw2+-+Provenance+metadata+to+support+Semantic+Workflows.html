        Summary of requirement pre-interview, by Reviewer:
      </td>
      <td>
        This will require additional information be collected about teh dataset, to go along side the data as an object.  Additionally, there will be metadata about the individual data fields, that will allow appropriate transformations if needed between codesets, and this higher level data will describe the things that need to have been done to the data &#34;the protocol&#34; for the data.
        There were 3 usage scenarios described for which having this type of metadata is needed.  It will describe the provenance metadata/pre-processing as a workflow at sufficent level of detail to learn about whether the data are suitable for processing for specific purposes.


        1: Construct, Store and Reuse workflows from existing discoverable data and services
        Narrative: A cancer researcher searches the grid or internet for data of interest and finds one or more sources of data in genomic repositories that is available for use.  He asks the system if there are any services on the grid that accept this kind of data, and expects for the system to tell him about the service, whether the data can be aggregated, if so it does it, if not it tells him why not and offers options for transforming the data so it will be usable.  The system detects if its possible to do something additional to the data to make it usable to the service (pre-processing), and if there is a transformation, allows him to find an existing transformation he can reuse,  or build and save a new transformation.  He can discover what processes or pre-processing was performed on the data he has found.  He can assess whether or not the data is really suitable for use based on some known, domain specific information the system has about this service, or the algorithms it uses, and compare the data to these known requirements, the system will tell him if it is a good match or not.  The system will let him make changes to the workflow, adding or removing steps.  The researcher can run the service with the data he has found and save the results.  When he saves the results, enough information about the workflow and the parameters/processes that were performed on the data are captured from the authoring tool to allow discovery and reuse of this workflow by others.

        2: Discover data of interest: A researcher wants to find data that has already been collected for use with caArray.  They are able to find the data and to inspect the system to learn about what type of cells are in the database, what type of pathology is available for the data, etc.

        3. Aggregate data of interest: A researcher is able to query the system to find data that can be combined with their data.  It is able to compare the characteristics of the dataset to ensure that the data are combinable, for example .

        Hello, my name is NAME. I am calling you today because NCI and caBIG are working toward a new and improved version of the semantic infrastructure to better support integration scenarios.   Our first step was to organize requirements collected over the past year. Your organization has expressed a requirement/need for BRIEF STATEMENT OF USER REQUIREMENT.  This has been identified as potentially a critical component to support application/data and service integration, and we need more information in order to enable us to meet this requirement.  Do you have about 30 minutes to talk about this?
