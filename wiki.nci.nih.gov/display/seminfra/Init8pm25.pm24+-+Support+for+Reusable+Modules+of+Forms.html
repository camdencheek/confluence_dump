      <td>
        In order to reuse a form module, which is a set of CDE questions, the form module is copied/referenced in the form.  It is copied because it is allowable for changes to be made to the module that do not propagate to other users of the module, e.g. removal of a CDE.  However, it is also referenced in the sense that changes to the original form module are propagated to all instances of the form module.
