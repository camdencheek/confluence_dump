A community model can be represented with different levels of detail to reflect different levels of detail in use cases, as shown in

. The &#34;Community detail&#34; and &#34;UML diagrams&#34; columns in the table provide a mapping from the use case levels to community modeling concepts and the associated UML for ODP notation.We illustrate these different levels of detail in community models using the simple Federated Repository example introduced in section

can be considered a community model representation of the level 0 use case (summary use case) as it only identifies key roles in the community and the community objective. Note we also add a Policy package as a placeholder for future requirements.This model can be further refined by adding the high-level interaction called Repository Access between the user and the system (level 2), as shown in Figure 4.3-1. This level can be further refined by adding detail to the interactions, specifying types of access to the Repository, namely Query, Identify and Aggregate Data (level 3). This is also depicted in the figure.
