This document summarizes our  draft technical approach which is based primarily on the Knowledge Repository (KR) request for  proposal (RFP). Of course, our approach will change as the scope of the KR project, and especially Release 1, becomes clear.

The  RFP called for two separate systems, a Metadata Registry (MDR) and a  Model Repository, with services that provide access to each. In  addition, Transformation/Knowledge Management (KM) Service interfaces  are to be engineered to create a unified, integrated view of the  contents of the two systems. In our approach, we implement the logically  distinct MDR, Model, and KM services through a common infrastructure.

The layers at the top of Figure 1 indicate how  the service components of the system are organized. The Knowledge  Management layer provides high-level, transformation and management  services, utilizing the MDR and Model service components. They present  ISO 11179 and UML specific APIs, respectively. The implementations of  these services use a common set of CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete),  Query, and Reasoning components that, in turn, utilize Eclipse Modeling  Framework (EMF) and W3C Semantic Web (SW) technologies. XML Metadata  Interchange (XMI) remains the primary import representation. However, we  use the EMF platform as the primary technology for manipulating  Meta-Object Facility (MOF) instance models. This allows us to utilize  the robust tooling of the Eclipse platform for CRUD and some  UML/MOF-oriented query and comparison operations.

We define  isomorphic transformations from EMF representations of MOF models  (including, but not limited to, UML) into an RDF/OWL ontologies. The  structures of the OWL ontologies depend on the M2-level MOF models.  Rule-based transformations are used to decompose UML models into data  descriptions (i.e. Object Classes (OCs), Data Elements (DEs), etc.) and  allow semantic metadata to be generated from line of business artifacts.  OWL representations of these views enable the use of Semantic Web  technologies to support sophisticated query and inference over the  models. Supporting creation of federated, inter-linked metadata becomes  (in a basic way) trivial since OWL utilizes URIs to represent concepts  and the relationships between them. This feature also facilitates both  top-down (e.g. BRIDG) and bottom-up (e.g. LS-DAM) approaches to model  reuse. The ovals that are located in and outside of the lower-right box  in Figure 1 depict how the OWL and ISO 11179 views may link to OWL and  11179 view and terminologies elsewhere, in other repositories. It also  shows that XML Schemas can easily link to concepts and data elements  using, for example, SAWSDL modelReference links. This enables metadata  driven XML transformations.

To provision fine-grained access  control policies and provide transaction support over EMF models, we use  an open source Object-relational Mapping (ORM) layer that is  specifically designed for persisting EMF models. To support  high-performance, extensible lexical matching algorithms, we index all  RDF/OWL content using the open source Lucene text search engine.
