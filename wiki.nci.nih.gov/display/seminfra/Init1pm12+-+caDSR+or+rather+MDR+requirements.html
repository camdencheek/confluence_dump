        Summary of requirement pre-interview, by Reviewer:
      </td>
      <td>
        It appears that the current construct of the CDE carries too many dependencies that make it hard to adopt (by parties other than the author).  For this, and other reasons, there is a proliferation of difficult to reuse CDEs.  One possible solution could be by expressing the ValueDomain as either XSD, RDF or OWL, then it would be much easier to reuse existing CDEs since one apply &#34;runtime semantics&#34; controlled by the adopters.  Another option is to distribute the metadata repositories across organizations, allowing Information Technologists to create and annotate their own metadata.  This issue has been discussed at length, and attached are some supporting documents.
