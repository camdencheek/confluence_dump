        Summary of requirement initial analysis, by Reviewer:
      </td>
      <td>
        --&gt;The structured eligibility criteria (SEC) use case supports eligibility screening - that is, matching eligible patients for protocols and vice versa, based on a predetermined set of criteria.

        It looks like we&#39;ll need to support at a minimum:

        1.  CDE lookup based on SEC - A protocol designer will need to be able to build and validate the SEC based on programmatic retreival of CDE metadata.
        2.  Forms (CDA) capability -SECs will be represented in CDA format, so a protocol designer will need to be able to create, store, retrieve and manage the lifecycle of CDA templates based on CDEs.
        There may be additional requirements on the model and rule repositories and services to determine reason about eligibility based on using rules about the CDEs containing the patient + protocol data e.g. Patient must be 30 years old at time of registration --&gt; would need to compare the CDE containing this patient information with the rule that they must be over 30 years old.
