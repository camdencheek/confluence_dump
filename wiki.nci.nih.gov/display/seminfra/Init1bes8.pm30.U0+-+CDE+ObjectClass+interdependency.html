        Brief Description
      </th>
      <td>
        Currently CDEs are bound to an object class which hinders reuse for developers. Although this supports domain information modeling, where classes actually represent real life entities, it does not support non-domain information modeling (e.g. summary classes, report classes that combine many attributes from different domain classes). Supporting such non-domain modeling practices and removing object class/DE dependency will be needed.
