        correct concepts from the correct terminologies can be a time consuming and error prone process.  Tooling should be integrated with the metadata modeling process to facilitate the reuse of standard semantics when reusing standard information models or common data elements.  This is especially important when deriving a model from a Domain Analysis Model (DAM).

        In addition to providing initial suggestions based on reused metadata, it may also be desirable to restrict the available terminologies for concept selection.  For example, specific domains may have terminologies that may be more appropriate than others, and different terminology services may be more appropriate for use when deriving from Domain Analysis Models (DAMs).
