1. Re-organization of use cases into levels


A, Wiki page with descriptions
We reviewed the wiki page with level descriptions as a group and agreed that it is good the way it is.

B, UML model
Patrick presented the UML model that he created for 8 out of about 30 use cases and their sub use cases that he has developed. The visual representation is useful and the group think it is a  good way to structure all the use cases.

Shantanu and Patrick will move forward with this approach for all use cases.

C, Wiki page with use cases in levels as text links
We quickly reviewed Shantanu&#39;s levels in text format and he will take these and turn them into UML models.

D, table with some additional elements based on ODP and UML
Zoran gives an overview and walks the group through his draft document &#34;Formalisation of use cases&#34;. This document will be shared with the group after the meeting for everyone to review.


2. Service Taxonomies

We review the definitions and decide to use this week to think about approaches on how to map the con op requirements to these four service taxonomies:

- Business/Process - Arbitrarily complex services that utilize the other three service types to carry out business functionsBusiness Capability

- Services that provide &#34;business atoms&#34;, the data most business processes utilize

- Core - Services that provide information components to capability and business services

- Infrastructure/Utility - Services that are required or utilized by virtually all other services (most of the SI services will be seen by others as fitting into this category in order for them to build their Business Process Services)
