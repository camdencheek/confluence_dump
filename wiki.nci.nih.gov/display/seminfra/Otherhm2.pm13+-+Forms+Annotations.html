        In data collections forms, it is often important to enforce specific rules that determine which data elements are captured.  These rules are termed as &#34;conditional&#34; CDEs or &#34;skip patterns&#34;.  For example, if male is selected for the gender CDE question, then the question about whether the patient is pregnant would be skipped.  More complex conditionals can be defined that require mathematical evaluation (less than, greater than), etc.

        In data collections forms, it is possible that the value of a CDE is derived from the values of other CDEs.  For example, an Address CDE may be derived from a set of CDEs for Street, ZipCode, City, and State.  A derived CDE is often combined with the non-editable flag so that, when presented in a form, the user does not directly edit the value because it is composed from other values.
