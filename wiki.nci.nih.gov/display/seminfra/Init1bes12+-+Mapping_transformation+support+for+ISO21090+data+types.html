        Business Goal: Provide support to current caBIG services for them to be able to exchange data with services who consume/produce ISO21090 data type containing messages/XML documents(serialized objects),
        Actor: Information Specialist
        ISO21090 data types will start to be used by several services. Existing services have been using programming language specific data types (e.g . Java). To be able to exchange data with services who consume/produce ISO21090 data type containing messages/XML documents(serialized objects), existing projects would either be redeveloped to use/implement ISO21090 data type libraries for their programming language of choice [VCDE:Alternative Solution] OR are provided a mapping tool (and/or transformation service) that will  transform native content with language specific data types to messages/XML documents containing ISO21090 data types. Possibly the mapping tool can produce a document as an input to a transformation service (describing how mapping should be done) or generate the code for service itself.
        The libraries in first solution or mapping tool in the second solution are  going to be used by Information Specialists (e.g. software developers).
