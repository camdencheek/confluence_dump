  Meeting Minutes
</h2>
Patrick is going to be out of the country for two months (Japan, China), but will continue working on the project. Will not be able to attend team calls.

1.    Re-organization of  use cases into levels

A. Shantanu to present his UML model

Shantanu presents his UML model and the group provides the following feedback:

Same levels should be horizontally aligned.

Some of the levels need to be adjusted.

Try to use action verbs to be more descriptive.

Shantanu will make a few adjustments until next meeting.


B, Patrick to present his UML model


2. Discussion of visual representation (bubbles, stick  figures,...)

3. Discussion of Community Concept

Zoran presents chart from his paper to group and group discusses the  community concept.


4. Taxonomies

Mapping use cases to taxonomies can be done in UML. Level 3 and 4 use  cases can be linked to taxonomies.

Zoran will take lead on this effort with the support of Patrick, who  will be traveling in the next months.


Additional Topic - SI Workflow:

We review the diagram in Denise&#39;s email from 5/13.  Zoran and Patrick will think about adding actors while working on  mapping use cases to taxonomies.
