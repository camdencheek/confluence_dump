        It is commonplace in bioinformatics to string together a number of data and analytical operations in order to produce the desired output.  In order for Cancer Researchers to discover which services can be piped together, it is necessary that the designers of the services expose the appropriate metadata.

      <td>
        caB2B relies on establishing/identifiying relationships between concepts (entities) and/or properties (attributes) exposed through a service&#39;s implementation models (currently registered in caDSR/advertised on caGrid). For instance, we need to be
        able to identify (or compute) Gene (entity from Model A) and MyFavoriteGene
        (entity from Model B) are representing identical concepts, even when the entities are not named the same. Furthermore that Gene.entrezGeneId property (attribute from model A) and MyGene.geneEntereId (attribute from model B) are representing the same property/attribute for the given concept.

        Currently NCIt concept mappings stored in the caDSR for the Object Classes and CDEs are leveraged to identify such relationships.  CDE mappings are the simplest to map across models because the CDE means that the physical database representation (syntax) is the same in the two models and can be directly aggregated.

        The new SI should continue to provide services and processes for us to be able to identify such relationships. In accordance with ECCF, the services/processes should at the minimum leverage the traceability (computable) among different levels of models (CIM-&gt;PSM) and compliance
        among model representations (PSM&lt;-&gt;PSM), caB2B should be able to easily discover this equivalence.

        caB2B uses value sets (that bind to concepts) to filter/constrain
        certain data elements in formation of queries to datasets. This requires runtime
        access (or metadata download prior to runtime) to possible values for
        specific data elements. Currently value domains that are associated with data elements stored in metadata repository (MDR/caDSR) are fetched and provided in query builders. The
        enumerated values are provided in pull down menus/lists to ensure the queries are formulated with correct allowable values. Similarly, although not supported by caB2B now,, the allowable ranges (e.g. 0 &lt;= Age &lt;= 130) and units of measure can also be provided to support correct query formulation.

        The new SI should continue to provide services and processes for us to be able to identify and compute the value set or allowable ranges or units of measure for querying data elements.
