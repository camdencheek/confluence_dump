AGENDA ITEM 1. Review prioritized Use Cases with each Business Analysts

Shantanu:

1. caIntegrator
Shantanu developed 6 use cases and sent them out for review/validation

2. TCGA
Meeting from Monday 9:30 am is rescheduled to Tuesday 9:30 am. Same login, same phone number.

3. Requirement sharing (Sue Dubman)
Shantanu sent his formal requirement statement to Sue Dubman for validation the week before last.

Shantanu hasn&#39;t heard back yet. Shantanu will forward the reminder email with attachment to Denise Warzel for future follow-up.

Mohamed:
The following two items are on same priority level:

1. caB2B
Meeting took place Wednesday (Feb 10, 2010) with Denise Warzel, Juli Klemm, Mukesh, Rakesh and Mohamed. Tool and System order was discussed. This requirement results in 6 use cases: 3 high level use cases and 3 specific to B2B.

Mohamed emailed these use cases to Mukesh to inquire about the order of priority and to see if there are any other requirements.

2. Forms

Mohamed will get acquainted with forms by using the guest login at formbuilder.nci.nih.gov
(login is in the sentence above fields on screen.)

Mohamed will participate in the following 4 NCI meetings regarding this topic this week:
Wednesday (full day), Thursday (full day), Friday(half day) and a one hour separate meeting.

AGENDA ITEMÂ  2. Master List clean-up

Rick has made several adjustments last week and is monitoring the consistency of three tables: participant chart, master list and Si Requirements Progression. A few names that have been added to the master list this week will need to be added to participant list. Team agrees that a semantic media wiki would make this process easier.
