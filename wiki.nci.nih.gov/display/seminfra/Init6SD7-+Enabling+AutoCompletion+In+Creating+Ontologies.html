        Summary of requirement pre-interview, by Reviewer:
      </td>
      <td>
        The primary actor is a cancer researcher intending to create an ontology for his/her domain.
        The essential business goal is to make Ontology creation a less enormous task.
        The major problem in creating ontologies is the scope of domain and the rate of knowledge acquisition. There is a need for a tool that would understand the domain and ask leading questions for the set of terms, relationships between those terms, and inference rules to
        reason on such terms.

        Hello, my name is NAME. I am calling you today because NCI and caBIG are working toward a new and improved version of the semantic infrastructure to better support integration scenarios.   Our first step was to organize requirements collected over the past year. Your organization has expressed a requirement/need for BRIEF STATEMENT OF USER REQUIREMENT.  This has been identified as potentially a critical component to support application/data and service integration, and we need more information in order to enable us to meet this requirement.  Do you have about 30 minutes to talk about this?
      </td>
      <td>
        yes
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>
        2
      </td>
      <td>
        Do you have any solution integration needs? If so, what are they? Have you envisioned new ways of interacting with existing or new parts of the semantic  infrastructure?
        (prompt to elicit changes/new ways of using the infrastructure)
      </td>
      <td>
        Multiple ontologies exist already, that have a well defined hierarchical relationships between the listed concepts. There is a need to reuse this information fully or partially while creating new ontologies. Therefore there is a need for a tool that would internalize these ontolologies and use them as a reference while creating new ontologies such that new ontologies can fully/partially use the relationship between various concepts.
