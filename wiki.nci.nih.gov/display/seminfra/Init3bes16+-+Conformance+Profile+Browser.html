        Business goal: To allow developers/reviewers to find conformance profiles that standardardize semantic and functional descriptions for services

        Actor: Information Technologist or conformance/compatibility reviewer

        An information specialist would like to develop a service that conforms to an existing conformance profile. He uses a browser to search the conformance profile that overlaps with the business goals of his service OR A reviewer have noticed a conformance profile was cited in one of the specifications provided by developer and wants to learn the details of profile. In this case the reviewer uses browser to search the profile cited in specifications.
        The browser interacts with a conformance profile registry or repository that stores conformance profiles.
        The search function can use different portions of conformance profile to formulate a query:
        - Semantic Profile
        Information model component names/annotations(class/attribute names)
        Component descriptions
         -Functional Profile:
        Operation definitions/names
        Operation annotation/description
        - Usage Context:
        Free style text search on Constraints, pre-conditions, organizational/ geopolitical/ temporal boundaries, or other pertinent contextual information
        - Profile Metadata
        Name
        Version
           Organization/authority

        Following search, using browser, the selected conformance profiles should be able to transformed to artifacts helping service implementation (e.g. WSDL). Browser should also provide a human readable version of conformance profile.
