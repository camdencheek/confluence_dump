      </th>
      <td>
        Some queries can be intractable or impractical to complete.  When the level of complexity of these types of queries is well understood, it is important that the Software Engineer is able to configure the query processor to handle them appropriately.  This includes the amount of data that can be returned, the length of time that can be spent processing a query, and the number of joins that are allowed.
