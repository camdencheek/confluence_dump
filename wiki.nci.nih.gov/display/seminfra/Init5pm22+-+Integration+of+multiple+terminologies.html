        Summary of requirement pre-interview, by Reviewer:
      </td>
      <td>
        Currently the NCI standard source for terminology is exclusively NCI Thesaurus. However, EVS has other terminologies available and will be accessing even more in the future. A mechanism needs to be developed to deal with overlap of terms from multiple sources. The caveat being that the same term in different sources may or may not be identical in meaning.  This will aid Information Modelers, Metadata Curators, and Terminologists.
