        caIntegrator2 has an EAV (Entity-Attribute-Value) mechanism for capturing datasets of new data types.  This is necessary for them to quickly capture new data for new types of data, which is a very frequent occurrence for their users.  However, they would like to represent the columns of these new datasets as CDEs in the caDSR so that the dataset can easily be interpreted and reused.  They have designed a model and a process by which they can easily create these new dataset types in their EAV model, link them to CDEs, and produce XMI that could be used to create an object-oriented view of the dataset.
        While this is similar to dynamic extensions, it does have some unique qualities.  These include the fact that there is an existing EAV model in use, the necessity to rapidly add entirely unique types of data, and the fact that the dataset itself is large and (for the most part) numerical (unlike clinical/tissue data).
