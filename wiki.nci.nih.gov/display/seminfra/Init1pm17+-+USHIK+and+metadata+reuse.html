        Summary of requirement pre-interview, by Reviewer:
      </td>
      <td>
        The US Health Information Knowledgebase (USHIK) is the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality&#39;s (AHRQ) metadata registry of the data elements and their characteristics from the standards that the HHS Secretary has endorsed, adopted, and recognized. This includes data elements from HIPAA transaction standards, Consolidated Health Informatics domains standards, and HITSP interoperability specifications. Since NCI and caBIG will be required to comply with the standards described in USHIK, our new semantic infrastructure must be capable of easily consuming information from the USHIK resource as static semantic content.
        USHIK is an ISO 11179 compliant metadata repository.  The URL for the site is:
        <a href="http://ushik.ahrq.gov" rel="nofollow">
          http://ushik.ahrq.gov
        </a>
        .  These requirements primarily will effect all consumers of the semantic metadata, including Information Technologists, Cancer Researchers, and Metadata Specialists.
