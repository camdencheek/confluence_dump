      </td>
      <td>
        A model owner (Actor) from CTRP needs to annotate his model. He need to create a CDE (e.g., NCI CTRP Disease) with a list of enumerate values by reference. EVS should provide the services that allow the model owner to search for a term (e.g., disease) and return all descendants of this term at once (hierarchical search).
