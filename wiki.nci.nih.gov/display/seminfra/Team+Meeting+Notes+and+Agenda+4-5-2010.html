  Meeting Minutes
</h2>
1. Introduction of three new Business Analysts  Alan Blair and Baris Suzek

Alan and Baris share their background and experiences. Clarification of flow: Storyboard -&gt; requirement -&gt; use case -&gt; sub use cases

Discussion of 5 viewpoints of RM-ODP:


1.       Business/Enterprise viewpoint
2.      Information viewpoint
3.      Computational viewpoint
4.      Engineering viewpoint
5.      Technology viewpoint

2. Updates to Requirement Gathering Template
Bea Mahious shows requested and implemented changes to the Requirement Statement template:
<ul>
  <li>
    additional line for revised statement
  </li>
  <li>
    additional line for link to use case
  </li>
  <li>
    added note to business analysts to keep &#34;watch&#34; on a requirement while writing a use case for it.
    Question about template titles clarified.
    New requests for changes are:
  </li>
  <li>
    delete &#34;by reviewer&#34;
  </li>
  <li>
    move the Statement up higher (right under the &#34;Requirement #)
  </li>
  <li>
    move all descriptions from 2nd column over to first column
  </li>
</ul>
3. Review of Periodic Table
Denise presents the ppt of the periodic table and group discusses changes in layout and labeling.

4. Presentation of use cases
shortened due to time constraints.
Patrick has worked on:
<ul>
  <li>
    Medidata - revisit with Christo&#39;s feedback
  </li>
  <li>
    caIntegrator
  </li>
  <li>
    Automate
  </li>
  <li>
    No questions
    Denise brings up idea of placing requirement statement directly on master list to lessen the problem of incorrect or incomplete names for Forum Topics such as &#34;Automate&#34;.
  </li>
</ul>
Shantanu has worked on:
<ul>
  <li>
    Content Browser
  </li>
  <li>
    No questions
  </li>
</ul>
5. Assignments for new business analysts
Alan Blair will be focusing on caDSR
Baris Suzek tbd

6. Meeting schedule
The group determines that a daily 15 minute meeting is not feasible for this group, because 3 analysts are not able to take part in these meetings. We decide to meet once or twice a week for one hour with the architect (Tom Digre) which will allow for a more in-depth review. Each analyst needs to be aware of what others are working on in order to determine inter-dependencies, conflicts and and to avoid duplications.
Bea Mahious presents a chart with the four time zones that the team works in. It becomes clear that some team members will have to work outside of regular business hours in order to get the entire group together.
We decide to set up a doodle poll to try and find one common time for everyone.
