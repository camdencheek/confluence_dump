        Business Goal: Streamline bulk load of content to MDR;  identify missing content (annotation, components, objects, data types, value domains) , create the new &#34;unique&#34; content.
        Actor: Metadata Specialist

        A Metadata Specialist (more specifically Metadata Curator),  working at NHLBI and other divisions, wants the ability to bulk/batch load new content from a variety of sources for later curation.

        So there is a need for a loading tool that will allow:
        -  Bulk/batch load contents in parsable formats to MDR (Knowledge reporistory)

        -  Match loaded content to potential reusable/existing metadata based on descriptions provided in content. Matching content is classified as &#34;used by/using&#34; an existing metadata item. For instance an indication showing it is reused by NHBLI content submitted at so-and-so date (source designation/attribution)

        -  If a perfect match is not possible or to provide more flexibility to user, allow navigation/search/exploration/mapping related capabilities. For instance allow fuzzy matching (e.g. anything but value domain match or a subset permissible values as reported already exists as part of an existing value domain)

        - If no content is matched, allow creation of new content

         The loading tool should allow the content to be partially formed and incomplete.

        Hello, my name is NAME. I am calling you today because NCI and caBIG are working toward a new and improved version of the semantic infrastructure to better support integration scenarios.   Our first step was to organize requirements collected over the past year. Your organization has expressed a requirement/need for BRIEF STATEMENT OF USER REQUIREMENT.  This has been identified as potentially a critical component to support application/data and service integration, and we need more information in order to enable us to meet this requirement.  Do you have about 30 minutes to talk about this?

        Being able provide the content loading capability set by this requirement.
        To help NCI stakeholders to be able to register their content easily in Knowledge Repository.
        To streamline the process through this tooling since volume of content is too large and current tooling does not scale up to this challenge.

        (prompt to elicit changes/new ways of using the infrastructure)
      </td>
      <td>
        The challenging part of this requirement is to be able to identify matched content. This step is time consuming and/or laborous. My expectations is to do this in a almost fully-automated fashion to be able to address a simple question such as what percentage of the content provided has a match in Knowledge Repository (e.g. a new/reusable proportion).

        One business change; a staging environment that allows use of full capacity of the required tool but do not publish the results/content until the task of matching/creation is completed.  While doing this, the identifier created for content should remaing the same even if the content is published later on.

        Yes. You use existing tools.
        The current model to achieve content load as described in the requirement with current tooling is too time consuming.
        Furthermore current tooling requires a lot manual work that may generate inconsistent/incomplete content because subject to human error/judgement/experience. The more automated this process gets the more consistent content we will be able to generate.

        You won&#39;t be able to scale up to content load need from community unless you use extensive human resources. Increasing the number of people for this task will result in more variability due to human factors.

      <td>
        A Metadata Specialist (more specifically Metadata Curator),  working at NHLBI and other divisions, wants the ability to bulk/batch load new content from a variety of sources for later curation.  Actually we would like expand the use of this tool beyond metadata specialist (e.g. regular users) so that at least initial matching capabilities of loading tool can be done by content owners.   So there is a need for a loading tool that will allow:
        - Set a search criteria to restrict the content matching. For instance limiting the match to all caBIG content or project such as caAERS or data standards only.
        -  Bulk/batch load contents in parsable formats (e.g. XLS, CSV, tables in a PDF/Word document) to MDR (Knowledge reporistory)
        -  Match loaded content to potential reusable/existing metadata based on descriptions provided in content. Matching content is classified as &#34;using&#34; an existing metadata item. For instance an indication showing content is reused by NHBLI content submitted at so-and-so date (source designation/attribution)
        -  If a perfect match is not possible or to provide more flexibility to user, allow navigation/search/exploration/mapping related capabilities. For instance allow fuzzy matching (e.g. anything but value domain match or a subset permissible values as reported already exists as part of an existing value domain)     - If no content is matched, allow creation of new content
        - Generate a reuse report based on the matches/searches. Reuse report should be detailed enough to capture different levels of metadata reuse (e.g. DEC, CDE, VD)
         The loading tool should allow the content to be partially formed and incomplete.  There should mandatory requirements for content (to assess completeness). However during loading process and prior to publising it the loading should allow to not to enforce mandatory requirements.

        The loading tool should allow staging the content load without publishing. The public identifier assigned to content should not change when the content is published.  The loading tool should prevent any content to be published if they don&#39;t meet mandatory requirements for the content. The content in staging phase should be able to shared among a collaborators in the community.

        For the step &#34;Setting up a search criteria to restrict the content matching.&#34;: The tool is expected to match to the content &#34;only&#34; available in the context/project or metadata restricted by the search criteria.
        For the step &#34;Bulk/batch load contents in parsable formats (e.g. XLS, CSV, tables in a PDF/Word document) to MDR (Knowledge reporistory)&#34;: The tool should be able to parse given format and notify user about a successful/unsuccessful load.
        For the step &#34;Match loaded content to potential reusable/existing metadata based on descriptions provided in content. Matching content is classified as &#34;using&#34; an existing metadata item.&#34;:  The tool should demonstrate it can match different levels of metadata. An easy performance/fit test will be reloading existing content in various forms, in which case the tool should have match 100% of the content.
        For the step &#34;If a perfect match is not possible or to provide more flexibility to user, allow navigation/search/exploration/mapping related capabilities.&#34;: The loader should demonstrate it can partially match different levels of metadata. An easy performance/fit test will be reloading existing content with slight variations (e.g. changing VDs, using subset of permissible values), in which case the tool should match all the content to different levels of metadata with exclusion of intented deviations.
        For the step &#34;If no content is matched, allow creation of new content&#34;: The tool will facilitate creation of new content.

        For the step &#34;Generate a reuse report based on the matches/searches. Reuse report should be detailed enough to capture different levels of metadata reuse (e.g. DEC, CDE, VD)&#34;: The tool should generate a report summarizing metadata reuse as different levels (e.g. percentage of VDs matched) and also listing the matched content in detailed form. The report should be printable for reading/revision.
        For the item &#34;The loading tool should allow the content to be partially formed and incomplete._  There should mandatory requirements for content (to assess completeness). However during loading process and prior to publising it the loading should allow to not to enforce mandatory requirements.&#34;:_ The tool should allow loading any content even if it requires loosing all the mandatory content requirements.

        For the item &#34;The loading tool should prevent any content to be published if they don&#39;t meet mandatory requirements for the content. &#34;: The tools should give an error if the requirements are not met and user tries to publish the content.

        For the item &#34;The content in staging phase should be able to shared among a collaborators in the community. &#34;: The user while working on the content, should be able to send a URL or pointer for others to browse/see content under development.
