        Information modelers have 4 areas of need:
        1. Iterative registration of semantics instead of backend loaded
        2. A way to make the semantics of use cases explicit and reusable in later steps that would like the use cases with formal information modeling and eventually the systems or services that implement them.
        3. Model reuse and capturing modifications: extensions and constraints
        4. Ability to more easily describe enumerations

        Hello, my name is NAME. I am calling you today because NCI and caBIG are working toward a new and improved version of the semantic infrastructure to better support integration scenarios.   Our first step was to organize requirements collected over the past year. Your organization has expressed a requirement/need for BRIEF STATEMENT OF USER REQUIREMENT.  This has been identified as potentially a critical component to support application/data and service integration, and we need more information in order to enable us to meet this requirement.  Do you have about 30 minutes to talk about this?

        In interacting with the caBIG infrastructure, do you have any solution integration needs? If so, what are they? Have you envisioned new ways of interacting with existing or new parts of the semantic  infrastructure?

      </td>
      <td>
        Iterative semantics registration: The semantics don&#39;t come into play until the end of the project.  You build the system then look at a few CDEs to get the picklists.  At the end you sit down and write the definitions and go through the full registration process - takes long to export files and submit/review/interact with loading team.  It should happen in the first iteration, they should be able to update the concepts and definitions and register it in the repository.  Business analyst (the person working hands on with the implementation models), someone oversees the development of the model.  The business analyst would hit the buttons&#39; that would try to register it in the repository, and provide interactive feedback on things that don&#39;t work.  It might not be the final version, but htey would have an opportunity to see the problems and issues as they develop rather than after they have implemented something.
        may  be resistance, developers just want to implement stuff. there is benefit to getting the stakeholders involved in teh informaiton model from the beginning.  CDE reuse is a challenge, the name or the enumeration isn&#39;t quite right.  Needs to be able to modify the CDE more easily, finding a CDE to reuse is hard.
        its hard to find models to reuse, but realize that if you reuse the same CDE you can reuse the data or services.
        Use case comes to the developer to implement it.  Sit in a room and talk about what needs to be done. Talk about the data that needs to be captured in the system.
        Developer takes notes. talk about classes of information and how they need to be associate - may talk about data elements.  The architect might draw some classes and associations on a white board.
        The developer sits in-front of EA and begins to create the information model.  The a group reviews it and discusses names and associations, in an interactive session. multiplicities - the developer fixes the problems during the sessions/makes another draft.  Ultimately comes up with something that the analyst is happy with and the bring it into the main model.  May involve new classes and associations, then hook it into the main model.  Then begins to hook it into the use case to implement the use cases.  Uses the use cases - sometimes not modeled - just notes from a discussion - unless working with the end user where they need to review it - won&#39;t be written, but may have something in a wiki page - with a narrative and a few bullets on the functionality and types of data...its more subjective or intuitive - introspective - conceptual idea from discussion.  figures out the semantics and lets you correct it in the wiki.

        Semantics for Use Cases: A more formal use might be developed after they know the understanding is correct, may have a working prototype - show it to the stakeholders - move the narrative into the formal use case.
        the information model classes might have data elements from different &#39;object classes&#39;, its just an information model to support the use case.  After they have developed the model and revised with user input, register the model of the application, not the domain ...should be able to produce the artifact needed at the end on a monthly basis instead of waterfall.
        ______
        Model reuse and capturing modifications: Domain analysis models and using existing models - how should this work?: it needs to be clearer how this is done. its not programmatic. You create a spreadsheet and show how they map into BRIDG - need a better way to model that in the metadata repository. Start with classes from BRIDG - but start adding o renaming classes and adding attributes, changing names, adding associations and so forth to support the use case.  Then at the end of the project ther is a BRIDG Review.  then map the attributes to the BRIDG attributes. Sometimes have the same name sometimes they don&#39;t. In one column their name, in the other column the BRIDG attribute.
        Would be good if you could derive these cl;asses into their own model, make changes that are kept track of and registered along side the original model.  and some information about the changes you have made so you can review them to be sure you haven&#39;t broken any rules, have reused stuff that exists.

        ___________
        Attaching Enumerations to models: in C3PR and other apps its difficult to use enumerated value domains.  They don&#39;t put them into the information model, but they do put them into the user interfaces.  They use configuration files are used for the application that can be changed by the user outside the software.  attach terminology to the &#39;confirguation file&#39; person.gender would not have associated values.  They ask what the values are when developing the software, they see what they are, but the don&#39;t put it into the information model ... hard to put EA ...  not intuitive or easy to attach the enumeration ... needs to be easy and be pulled in the enumeration and modify it if it already exists ...
