      </td>
      <td>
        The Primary actor is a ontology engineer/information technologist trying to create an ontology

        Business goal is to have a proper processes, guidelines and checks and balance in place for creation of an ontology thus making the process less disruptive.
        There needs to be a set of &#39;best-practices&#39; that needs to be defined for building an ontology. These &#39;best-practices&#39; and the defined preferred/standardized relations would make transition to new ontology a less tectonic event.

        Hello, my name is NAME. I am calling you today because NCI and caBIG are working toward a new and improved version of the semantic infrastructure to better support integration scenarios.   Our first step was to organize requirements collected over the past year. Your organization has expressed a requirement/need for BRIEF STATEMENT OF USER REQUIREMENT.  This has been identified as potentially a critical component to support application/data and service integration, and we need more information in order to enable us to meet this requirement.  Do you have about 30 minutes to talk about this?

        Do you have any solution integration needs? If so, what are they? Have you envisioned new ways of interacting with existing or new parts of the semantic infrastructure?
        (prompt to elicit changes/new ways of using the infrastructure)
      </td>
      <td>
        There is a need for a tool that would internalize various ontolologies and use them as a reference while creating new ontologies such that new ontologies can fully/partially use the relationship between various concepts.

        Existing tools that are based on the previously existing ontologies can continue to be viable even if there are new ontologies available.

        Existing software tools can continue to leverage the new ontologies thus these tools would have a longer shelf life
