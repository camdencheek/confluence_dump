Bea thanks team for submitting vacation times and reminds everyone to send hours for November and December. These hours will be used strictly for planning purposes.

Overview of changes to master list since last meeting:
<ul>
  <li>
    description of columns and how to use them is now UNDER the list
  </li>
  <li>
    there shall be NO DUPLICATE listings in the master list. Cindy s helping to clear out doubles. Questions will be clarified separately by email between Cindy and Denise.
  </li>
  <li>
    Bea posted Baris&#39; new requirements under Init 1 metadata. Baris to insert questionnaire as usual.
  </li>
  <li>
    in the interest of pairing up ONE RA with ONE interviewee, some topics have been re-assigned to another RA for the step of interviewing. This is marked in the master list in column &#34;Analyst&#34;. We will also find a spot to note who will take a certain requirement on as Business Analyst to create the use case where necessary.
  </li>
  <li>
    Note: The name of one RA may now be listed next to many topics. Not all requirements will be set up for interviews in round 1 or round 2. Focus on Round 1 and Round 2 (as will be marked)
  </li>
  <li>
    No all Round 1 items are &#34;in progress&#34; in the master list yet, please share concerns raise flags if you need help.
  </li>
</ul>
Update from Requirement Analysts:

Patrick:

- completed all assigned decompositions

- created list of actors


- Joel Saltz&#39;s requirements are straight forward

- Question Christo Andonyadis- wait for Christo Andonyadis

- Frank Hartel: will need at least 2 interviews to cover all topics.

HL7 - Patrick (email)

LSDAM and conformance profile - Patrick and Baris (interview 1)

external party regulations   - Baris and Shantanu (interview 2)

ontology - Shantanu (interview 3)

21090 data types - follow up with Avenash, inform and keep in the loop

General discussion and decision: don&#39;t enter details that are too granular


Baris:

completed 2 interviews: Sal Mungal and Tejas Dave (both will be linked to same use case)

Lessons Learned: It would be helpful to have a second person on call to help take notes.

Interview with Sharon Gaheen is set up for Tuesday 12/22

Question/Answer: A new requirement that comes out of an interview is to be entered in the master list with a link to either a questionnaire or to a descriptive narrative of a high-level use case. In this case write &#34;Interview&#34; in the source column.


Hua:

- highest priority is B2B

- Interview with Rekesh is set up for 12/30/2009. Patrick will join her on that call. Use Brian&#39;s call-in number.

- Bob Freimuth interview will take place in January


Shantanu:

is part of call with Frank Hartel (see above)


Following this meeting Denise will have one-on-one with Hua and Shantanu to go through topics and help prioritize.

Discussion on need to surface the next steps in the master list. (See action items)
