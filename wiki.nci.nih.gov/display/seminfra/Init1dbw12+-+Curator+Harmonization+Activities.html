        Curators need support on two levels, the basic CRUD services and those who need to do more detailed metadata maintenance/clean-up/monitoring functions.  Services are needed that will support use cases such as:   - review for completeness,  - identify redundancy,  - clean-up 11179 building blocks, - identify baseline and report metrics, etc.)    We can think of more activities that need to be supported.   Some of these functions are currently supported by using Oracle Discover or Sentinel but there are many that are labor intensive that could be streamlined by new tooling.
