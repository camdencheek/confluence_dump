        Summary of requirement pre-interview, by Reviewer:
      </td>
      <td>
        The primary actor here is a cancer researcher who does not know the technical nitty gritties of grid.
        The business goal is to make the searches on the grid natural language based.
        caBIG tools should interface with a Natural Language Processing based search engine that can crawl on caGRID and come up with answers to questions based searches rather than key words searches.
