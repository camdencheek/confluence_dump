        the submitter is already listed in the master list. In cases where the submitter is not the person we really need to talk to becasue they submitted on behalf of someone else, I think it would be better to add the other person(s)&#39; name(s) and email to the master list, rather than in here.
        My suggestion: delete this row, and use master list &#34;submitter&#34; column instead. We could rename that column to &#34;originator/submitter&#34;

        The updated description that asks for (1)actor, (2)business goal and (3)how to achieve it is better. The summaries that are written now cover all three elements.
        Alternative option: We could also ask them as three separate questions, but then we will loose the narrative flow.

        Hello, my name is NAME. I am calling you today because NCI and caBIG are working toward a new and improved version of the semantic infrastructure to better support integration scenarios.   Our first step was to organize requirements collected over the past year. Your organization has expressed a requirement/need for BRIEF STATEMENT OF USER REQUIREMENT.  This has been identified as potentially a critical component to support application/data and service integration, and we need more information in order to enable us to meet this requirement.  Do you have about 30 minutes to talk about this?

      <td>
        In real life this will not go exactly as written here, but having this item int he questionnaire serves as a reminder to introduce oneself and to give a short background on why we are calling. And to explain where and how the information will be used before asking the following questions.

        At one point we had discussed moving this categorization of functional vs. non-functional into the master list.
        If we do, we&#39;ll be able to sort by it and we can delete it here.
        How important is it to be able to sort by it? It&#39;s my impression that almost all topics are talking about functional requirements, but I may be wrong.
