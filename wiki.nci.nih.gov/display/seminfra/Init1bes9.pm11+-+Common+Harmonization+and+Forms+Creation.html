        Common data elements can be entered into the metadata repository through a variety of different tools, including a UML loader, manual curation through the web interface, and forms development.  There must be a common harmonization mechanism enforced by the metadata repository such that all mechanisms by which CDEs are entered can be reused by all types of users.

            Email Requirements: In the course of retrieving the metadata for a CRF from the caDSR, the AGNIS Metadata Tool sends a large number of web service requests to the cadsrapi40Service web service.  This can take a long time, due to the large number of round trips to the server.  One possible way to improve performance would be to implement a caDSR API that, instead of returning only one object at a time, could return a graph of objects in response to a single web service request.  This would move processing to the server side, where it can be done more efficiently, and also improve performance by reducing the number of round trips to the server.
