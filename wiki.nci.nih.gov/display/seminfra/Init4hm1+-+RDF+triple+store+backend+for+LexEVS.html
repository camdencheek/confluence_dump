        Summary of requirement pre-interview, by Reviewer:
      </td>
      <td>
        The primary actor for this requirement is Information Modelers. The goal of this requirement is leveraging the LexGrid model with Semantic Web standards and specifications. The LexRDF model will map the LexGrid model elements to corresponding constructs in W3C specifications. The data in the LexGrid will translate into RDF triples. LexEVS will query the RDF triples with Semantic Web query language.

        Hello, my name is NAME. I am calling you today because NCI and caBIG are working toward a new and improved version of the semantic infrastructure to better support integration scenarios.   Our first step was to organize requirements collected over the past year. Your organization has expressed a requirement/need for BRIEF STATEMENT OF USER REQUIREMENT.  This has been identified as potentially a critical component to support application/data and service integration, and we need more information in order to enable us to meet this requirement.  Do you have about 30 minutes to talk about this?
      </td>
      <td>
        Yes.

        Do you have any solution integration needs? If so, what are they? Have you envisioned new ways of interacting with existing or new parts of the semantic  infrastructure?
        (prompt to elicit changes/new ways of using the infrastructure)
      </td>
      <td>
        1. The LexRDF model should translate the LexGrid model elements to corresponding constructs in W3C specifications such as RDF, OWL and SKOS.
        2. The terminological information represented in LexGrid should be translated into RDF triples.
        3. LexEVS should leverage the Semantic Web Tools (e.g., SPARQL) and technologies into LexGrid.
