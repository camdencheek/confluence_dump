        Hello, my name is NAME. I am calling you today because NCI and caBIG are working toward a new and improved version of the semantic infrastructure to better support integration scenarios.   Our first step was to organize requirements collected over the past year. Your organization has expressed a requirement/need for BRIEF STATEMENT OF USER REQUIREMENT.  This has been identified as potentially a critical component to support application/data and service integration, and we need more information in order to enable us to meet this requirement.  Do you have about 30 minutes to talk about this?

        In interacting with the caBIG infrastructure, do you have any solution integration needs? If so, what are they? Have you envisioned new ways of interacting with existing or new parts of the semantic  infrastructure?

        1. We need a Forms Registry that results in operational CRFs.  This means the form metadata and the CDEs. The forms need to be able to be exchanged in a standard format, that allow reuse to collect semantically unambiguous data on CRFs.  Possible parties that you would exchange these forms with are caBIG, BIGHealth, CDISC and software vendors like Velos or Medidata how have clinical trials management systems that could take in teh forms descirptions and use them and the CDEs to customize their application.
        The content of the form needs to be in a standard &#39;container&#39;, we need to lead the industry to adopt standard form, something as lightweight as an XML XForm.
         We need authoring tools to create the CRFs, be able to consume fo the forms and operationalize them to collect data in a CTMS system like Medidata.
        2. We will need more enterprise services.  We need services that can be consumed by other applications, where you don&#39;t have to do so much work to get the data out (no training, not &#39;learning&#39; the data model).  Nee to be able to represent the choreography .. the path through the form.
        3. We need workflow engines
        4. We need to be able to build applications, shouldn&#39;t have to rebuild/annotate the common things. Maximizing reuse of services minimize development of new services  Make it easier to share, applications are too hard to integrate and interoperate.  Better support the &#34;adapt&#34; patter, make it easy to work with other systems.
        5. Rules: anyone anywhere should be able to find a service, see the little pieces about a protocol that need to be added or changed in order to reuse the data or service.  Need ot be able to modify systems to include important steps or data.  Need the right set of attributes to describe a protocol, find the state diagram for a protocol and inspect it, reuse it.
        6. Security in clinical science is a big issue.  Tools need to allow people to build applications with authorization and authentication.
        7.  need services to author authorizations
        8. Develop standard &#34;Roles&#34; for accessing content so the security profiles can be reused. An ontology for roles.

        Yes, the caDSR APIs for pulling data our of caDSR are used, but they are not useful enough.  The end user has to know too much about the caDSR data model to get things out.  It needs to be easeir to retrieve whole &#34;Forms&#34; or whole or parts of &#34;Models&#34;.
