1. and 2. script template AND master list
We collected feedback from each requirement analyst on the master list and the questionnaire.
<ul>
  <li>
    is questionnaire complete?
  </li>
  <li>
    are all items useful?
  </li>
  <li>
    do RAs follow the script while on phone and fill in each item? Is the format helpful?
    How do you like working with the master list. What works , what doesn&#39;t?
  </li>
</ul>
Feedback on master list and questionnaire:
<ul>
  <li>
    Suggestion to split questionnaire in three separate templates (Initial Analysis, Interview, Post-Interview)
  </li>
  <li>
    editing in VKC wiki is a challenge and time-consuming. Semantic wiki would be easier.
  </li>
</ul>
Avoiding duplications questionnaire and master list
<ul>
  <li>
    &#34;recommended next step&#34; is also in master list. Can we eliminate it in questionnaire, so we don&#39;t need to update in two places?
  </li>
  <li>
    move categorization of &#34;functional/non-functional&#34; one level up to master list and delete here?
  </li>
  <li>
    delete in post interview &#34;Initiative&#34; - it&#39;s already in the master list
  </li>
  <li>
    additional question for questionnaire: If tools/services/software to meet this requirement is developed, do you consider to install them locally at your institute? Do you think an open source solution is essential?
    -it would be helpful to see a workflow diagram, in order to get an overview of all the steps and for easy understanding of where ones work fits into the process. It would be useful for determining what the best next step to recommend is.
  </li>
  <li>
    rewrite question 13: some interviewees are not comfortable with the idea to be the official originator of a requirement. Sometimes it might be better to have another originator than the one who submitted the requirement. Several submitters submitted their forum topic on behalf of someone else or on behalf of a group.
  </li>
  <li>
    question: how useful is it to ask whether a person will be expect to be satisfied when you fulfil their request? Perhapsthis needs to be worded differently. Right now everyone answers that they will be satisfied.
  </li>
  <li>
    it would be helpful for RAs to receive an automatic notification when a new item is assigned to them or when a next step is approved that they need to get started on.
  </li>
</ul>
