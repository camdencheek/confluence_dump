        Summary of requirement pre-interview, by Reviewer:
      </td>
      <td>
        caDSR needs to be queryable by an open source tool that is as robust and flexible at digging out complex data scenarios and generating BI and Analytics as Oracle Discoverer.
        The main actors here would be an Information Technologist or a Metadata Specialist  looking for data of his interest.The chief business goal is to make caDSR more intelligent and efficient thus reducing the effort it takes to generate business intelligence from a metadata repository like caDSR
