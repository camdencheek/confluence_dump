        Summary of requirement pre-interview, by Reviewer:
      </td>
      <td>
        Provide services metadata that can be consumed by applications such that applications like caB2B and Traverna can query the metadata infrastructure to discover data that can be used as input to particular services for new analysis. This might involve running the data through several pre-processing analysis steps first, building a data warehouse, then inputting it to another service.  Users should be able to save their query, and resultant workflow and the results for reuse or for use by others. (dbw)
        Use Cases from Avinash:      •      User can query for all pre-cancerous biospecimens from caTissue instances like those at Washington University, Thomas Jefferson University, and Holden Comprehensive Cancer Center.   •      User can identify the sample obtained for Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) and the corresponding CT image information. This query can be performed by querying across caTissue and NBIA using caB2B.   •      User can find out if a sample used in an expression profiling experiment is available for a SNP analysis experiment. This query can be performed by querying across caTissue and caArray using caB2B.   •      User can search for a particular gene based on the Entrez Gene ID and its related information  e.g. messenger RNA and protein information from GeneConnect.
