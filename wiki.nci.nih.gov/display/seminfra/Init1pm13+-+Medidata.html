        Medidata is the clinical trials database selected by NCI for use at trial sites.  Medidata supports the import and creation of forms by Forms Authors based on common data elements.  Associated with this are likely to be a number of use cases on the functionality that Medidata needs for querying and importing CDEs and forms.  See attachments for additional information.

            One of the requirements currently not met is the need to be able to   specify that a CDE on a form can have multiple answers selected from the   enumerated value list.   Currently this is captured in the Question   Instruction of the Form objects.  Users would like to be able to specify   this for the CDE.  one approach is to create a Derived Data Element   composed of the number of CDEs that are permitted in the response.  this   can be supported in the current 11179 Ed 2 metamodel.
            Furthermore, it appears that what is needed is a collection of  metadata &#34;things&#34; - forms, CDEs, etc. that are named and have  privileges.  There are some in global scope (managed by a certain few  people), a user can create any number of them, and that user can make  his publicly available (say, give me John&#39;s public collections, then  give me John&#39;s Breast Stdy 123 collection).  There would be a service  (API) with these types of functions.
