        Thank you for taking the time to talk to me. As you know from our email exchange. I&#39;m working as a requirement analyst for an effort by NCI and caBIG, as we are working toward a new and improved version of the semantic infrastructure. The first step is to talk to stakeholders to get their perspective.  My understanding is that you/your organization/community has expressed an interest in using caBIG solutions in some part of their work. I am talking with you today to collect more information in order to enable us to meet this requirement.
