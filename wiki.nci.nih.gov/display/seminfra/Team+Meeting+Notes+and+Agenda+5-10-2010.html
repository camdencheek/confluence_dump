  Meeting Minutes
</h2>
1.	CDISC meeting  and preparation meeting
We decide to have an internal preparation meeting this week with Margaret Haber and Dianne Reeves.
Our plan is to meet next week we will meet with Rhonda for an interview led by Patrick regarding CDISC.

2.	Google spreadsheets
Discussion of B2B item&#39;s category. Can it be labeled transformation or not. The definition of &#34;transformation&#34; is looked up at
<a href="https://wiki.nci.nih.gov/display/EAWiki/Candidate+NCI+Enterprise+Services" rel="nofollow">
  https://wiki.nci.nih.gov/display/EAWiki/Candidate+NCI+Enterprise+Services
</a>
and it is decided to label this requirement with &#34;transformation&#34;.
Baris shares the news that he is now the primary contact for caB2B, which is moving to Georgetown.
The third column is now final and can be updated in the master list by Rick Kiefer.

3.	Re-organization of use cases into levels

Our overall plan is to complete the following steps:

1. Mapping to Candidate NCI Enterprise Services (Periodic Table)
2. Organize requirements via Use Case &#34;leveling&#34; (using the agile levels:

Summary Goals: (White)
- Cloud - Very high level, involve multiple user goals &#34;Operate a  Biospecimen Repository&#34;
- Kite - High level, a process that takes place over several  hours, days or weeks involving many steps &#34;Find Usable Samples

User Goals: (Blue)
- Sea Level - User Goal, something the actor is trying to get done  - &#34;one person, one sitting&#34;, involves several underwater or clam level
- Subfunction Goals: (Indigo or Black)
- Underwater - needed to accomplish user goals, typically can be  used and reused - &#34;Save as a File&#34;
- Clam - Â not usually written out in detail as a use case, &#34;insert  record into database&#34;

These should be combined with caEHR&#39;s descriptions of &#39;levels&#34; that Patrick will share with the team.
The goal is to create a new wiki page with a description of each level and link to sub-use cases within each level. Many of the use case templates contain more than one use case and each one of these might be on a different level. They will be linked from this new wiki page.

3. Mapping requirements to NCI Service Taxonomy Categories (Business  Process, Business Capability, Core, Infrastructure/Utility). See top of:
<a href="https://wiki.nci.nih.gov/display/EAWiki/Candidate+NCI+Enterprise+Services#CandidateNCIEnterpriseServices-Infrastructure" rel="nofollow">
  https://wiki.nci.nih.gov/display/EAWiki/Candidate NCI Enterprise Services
</a>
<ul>
  <li>
    Business/Process - Arbitrarily complex services that utilize the  other three service types to carry out business functions
  </li>
  <li>
    Business Capability - Services that provide &#34;business atoms&#34;, the  data most business processes utilize
  </li>
  <li>
    Core - Services that provide information components to capability  and business services
  </li>
  <li>
    Infrastructure/Utility - Services that are required or utilized by  virtually all other services (most of the SI services will be seen by  others as fitting into this category in order for them to build their  Business Process Services)
  </li>
</ul>
4. Hand-off business requirements to the architects and high priority use cases that address the gaps in SI
