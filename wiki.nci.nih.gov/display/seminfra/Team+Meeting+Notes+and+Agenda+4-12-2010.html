1. Review simple stories
Patrick McConnell presents the work he has done with Ram, Joshua, Alan and Tom in a brainstorming session last Thursday to come up with a &#34;short list&#34; of simple user stories that represent the requirements for Initiative 1 (Knowledge Repository project)

Question: Should these user stories be oriented around a feature or around scenarios?
Answer: We decide that it is more useful to write them scenario/ action oriented.

Question: Are these user stories still worded too technical?
Answer: There are two main audiences for these user stories:
a. technical modelers
b. clinician
Stories around clinician related scenarios / actions that a clinician wants to perform need to be worded less technical language.

Question: How do we ensure traceability of the user stories back to the requirements/ forum entries/...?
Answer: Each user story may relate to more than one requirement, and each requirement may relate to more than one user story. A matrix can be developed for traceability.

Question: Are the user stories we have so for all related to Init 1 (Knowledge Repository project)?
Yes, but others will be added for RE purposes.

Next steps on User stories:
-&gt; Look though other initiatives to add and create more complete list. (All analysts)
-&gt; Baris can contribute user stories related to ICR
-&gt; Shantanu can contribute user stories about imaging

2. Periodic table
Review of the
<a href="https://wiki.nci.nih.gov/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=63996377" rel="nofollow">
  latest version of the periodic table

Suggestions:
<ul>
  <li>
    add another blue box for &#34;transformations&#34; in the bottom part &#34;semantic profiles&#34;
  </li>
  <li>
    some visual indication which of the items in &#34;semantic profiles&#34; are ISO 11179 standards?
  </li>
  <li>
    show rules differently?
  </li>
</ul>
