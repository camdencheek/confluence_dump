Reformatted Master List: Our main goal was to make the table more usable by being able to fully use the sorting feature and
therefore save time and make all our jobs easier.

The big changes are:
1.  Everything is in one table now, so you can sort all entries by initiative, by analyst, by submitter, etc... (default sort is by initiative)

2. Two columns have been eliminated: source and forum topic

3. We changed the term pre-interview in the table to initial analysis, because not every topic requires an interview, so the term pre-interview is not always correct. It still refers to filling in the first section of the script/template (also referred to as the questionnaire)

4. Because in many cases more than one analyst will work on a given entry, there are now 3 columns (Initial Analyst, Interview Analyst, Use Case Analyst). Seperating the analysts into separate columns allows us to sort by Analyst and it will be easier for Analysts to see their assigned requirements.

5. IMPORTANT: there are two new columns that we will use to communicate with each other. After an RA works on a given entry s/he fills in Recommended Next Step Column (see possible entries in explanation under the table). Then before moving on to that next step wait for approval by Denise. She will place an &#34;a&#34; or &#34;p&#34; in the Approval Column to let you know whether or not the next step is approved (a) or pending (p).
It is important that this column is cleared when you enter a new recommended next step.
For example: your recommended next step was Follow-Up Interview and you got an &#34;a&#34; for approved from Denise in the approval column. Then you conduct the interview and change your recommended next step to &#34;Use Case Template&#34;.  At this point, it is essential that you delete the &#34;a&#34; that is still in the approval column, so that Denise can review your recommendation and place a new &#39;a&#34; or &#34;p&#34; for your recommendation &#34;Use Case Template&#34; .
New suggestion by Denise: We need to combine the three columns (status, recommended next step, and approval) so that we can see the previous steps and their approval status.
Everyone will fill in this column with new codes so that Denise can go through and review/approve.
W - Waiting for Approval (instead of R- recommended next step)
I - In progress
A - Approved
C - Completed
WR - Waiting Room (instead of p for pending)

6. Links to questionnaires, use cases and other: All questionnaire links that used to be linked to the words &#34;in progress&#34; have been moved to the column &#34; requirement links&#34;. In this column place all your links. For example the questionnaire, the use case template, a narrative high-level use case,
