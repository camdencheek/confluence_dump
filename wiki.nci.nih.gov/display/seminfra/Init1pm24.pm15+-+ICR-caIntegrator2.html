      <td>
        From caIntegrator, the user should be able to query the metadata repository to link dataset fields to CDEs.  The data element description should be able to be imported, as well as unique identifiers/links to the CDE.  It would be convenient if caIntegrator could query the metadata registry to all possible matches to all dataset fields and present them in batch to the user.

        For those dataset fields that do not semantically match a CDE in the metadata repository, the user can export a file that has the field annotations that can be used to create new CDEs.  Furthermore, it may be possible for the user to export a full XMI (or other file) that describes the dataset in an object-oriented way.
