      <td>
        To date, metadata browsing in caBIG has not easily facilitated reuse of large portions of models.  It is highly desirable for an Information Modeler to provide side-by-side comparison of their model with those that are already registered in the metadata repository.  The goal of such a comparison is to identify differences in the models that may ultimately result in gaps in interoperability.  The side-by-side comparison should be easy to perform, be customizable, and provide (minimally) a round-trip with the modeling tool.

            The Information Modeler enters the model comparison process (through his modeling tool or an external model browser)
          </li>
          <li>
            The model comparison shows in a tabular fashion the differences between his model and the one that he is comparing it to
            <ol>
              <li>
                The Information Modeler should be able to select those model details and semantic details that he wishes to display in the table
              </li>
              <li>
                In addition to the automated comparisons, the Information Modeler should be able to manually connect pieces of the model that he knows to be &#34;equivalent&#34;
              </li>
              <li>
                The comparison should facilitate understanding the commonalities and differences through the use of color coding
              </li>
              <li>
                The comparison should be sortable by level of reuse (e.g. entire CDE reuse, partial reuse, etc.)

            It is not necessary that the initial model created by the Information Model be registered in the metadata repository, but, if so, it must be possible to &#34;unregister&#34; the model should the Information Modeler choose.

            An equivalent graphical flow should be provided that shows the models side-by-side in a typical UML graphical view
          </li>
          <li>
            An equivalent tabular and graphical flow should be provided for adding additional models to compare (i.e. more than 2)
