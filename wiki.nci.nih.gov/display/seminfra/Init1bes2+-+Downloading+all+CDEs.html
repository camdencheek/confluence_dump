      <td>
        Business Goal: To improve/streamline metadata reuse
        Actor: Information Specialist (Modeler)
        Modelers need browsers that download selected (or all) search results (can be model components or DEs) in an XML format compliant with ISO 11179 schema. In a federated metadata repository structure this will involve communicating multiple instances of repositories.

        Hello, my name is NAME. I am calling you today because NCI and caBIG are working toward a new and improved version of the semantic infrastructure to better support integration scenarios.   Our first step was to organize requirements collected over the past year. Your organization has expressed a requirement/need for BRIEF STATEMENT OF USER REQUIREMENT.  This has been identified as potentially a critical component to support application/data and service integration, and we need more information in order to enable us to meet this requirement.  Do you have about 30 minutes to talk about this?
      </td>
      <td>
        Yes

      </td>
      <td>
        Do you have any solution integration needs? If so, what are they? Have you envisioned new ways of interacting with existing or new parts of the semantic  infrastructure?
        (prompt to elicit changes/new ways of using the infrastructure)
      </td>
      <td>
        We need browsers that interact with and search Knowledge and Model Repositories and support:
        <ul>
          <li>
            Selection/configuration of repository instances to use: In a federated environment, user should be able to choose/configure which model and/or knowledge repository instances s/he wants to use.
          </li>
          <li>
            Search and discovery:  The browsers should allow developers/modeler to be able to discover/search the model or metadata components. The searches can be against:
            -Project names
            -Model package names
            -Description of model components (classes/attributes)
            -Semantic annotation (concepts)
            -Value domains/permissible values
            -Any text field that is provided for the model or associated metadata (free text search)
          </li>
          <li>
            Presentation of search results: The search results should:
            -Allow selection of the search results (partial or complete) added in a shopping cart (basket) that can be exported in XMI (if needed transformed to classes for modeling tool consumption) and  XML compliant with ISO 11179 XSD.
          </li>
        </ul>

        (prompt to elicit expectations/dependencies)
      </td>
      <td>
        Knowledge/model repository and browser (or browsers) to support easy discovery/visulization and download of semantic metadata and/or model components.  The tools should support export formats that are widely used by modelers/developers.

      </td>
      <td>
        CDE Browser, UML Model Browser
        Rigid /static in terms of view (not dynamic). So textual hard to understand. Performance. Comparison is primitive. Color coding is not user friendly. Discovering and reusing model components is not easy.

      </td>
      <td>
        Modelers/developers will be able to use browsers for modeling purposes; improving their models by identifying right components to use. Furthermore they will be able to use browser exports directly in modeling tools.

        If, for any reason, we were not able to create that solution, do you think there might be another way to solve this issue? Can you think of an alternative solution?
        (prompt to elicit alternative solutions/workarounds)
        (to be prepared by the Requirement Analyst)
      </td>
      <td>
        One alternative solution, other then those involve more manual work for developers/modelers, will be facilitating direct interaction of modeling tools with model or knowledge repository and allowing all metadata to be pulled to modeling tool. One downside of this solution is the number of modeling tools and challenges around the selection of which one(s) to support.

            In the results view, I should be able to select components from the search results (no upper boundaries) and  export selected components (classes or translated versions if they are CDE) in XMI format. This XMI format should be importable to a modeling tool.  Alternatively the export operation should generate an XML document compliant with ISO 11179 schema
