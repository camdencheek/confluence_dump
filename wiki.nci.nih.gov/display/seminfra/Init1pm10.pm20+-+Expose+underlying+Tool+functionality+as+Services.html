      <td>
        The metadata/semantic tools in caBIG provide a rich set of functionality that may be useful to Information Technologists (especially Software Engineers) in a programmatic/service manner.  The tools themselves would need to be refactored to expose the underlying functionality as services so that an application engineer could invoke the services to perform add, change or delete content in the metadata registry, or retrieve content to use the metadata in their user interface.  In this scenario, the same business rules that are applied in the manual curation of content would need to be in the services.  Examples also include new services to perform Value Domain matching, CDE and/or UML oriented searches that easily bring back associated components
