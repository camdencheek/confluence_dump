A Brain Tumor in silico use case consists of determining genetic, gene expression and outcome correlates of high resolution nuclear morphometry in the diffuse gliomas and their relation to MR features using Rembardt and TCGA datasets.  This involves integrative analysis involving Pathology, Radiology and molecular data.  The following semantic infrastructure use cases fall out of these requirements:

        Specific scientific data elements will be shared amongst collaborators, requiring the need for a way to semantically describe the data.  However, through the course of the study, new data elements will be added and some data element may change.  Therefore, there is a need for an agile modeling approach that does not require significant effort to modify the information model and register the semantic metadata.
