        Summary of requirement pre-interview, by Reviewer:
      </td>
      <td>
        MD Anderson is one of potentially many cancer research organizations that will be adopting non-caBIG technologies in order to meet their research and enterprise goals.  However, it is highly desirable to adopt caBIG/NCI metadata standards in order to be able to share data and build interoperable systems.  The challenge is that there is a need to develop localized data elements and terminologies that are not centrally managed at NCI.  Different departments, labs, clinics, etc. within the research organization desire to maintain ownership of their metadata while still reusing common standards whenever possible.  Therefore, the proposal is to federate the metadata infrastructure such that different organizations, departments, labs, software applications, etc. can maintain their own metadata while standards flow both top-down and bottom-up.  The current semantic infrastructure at NCI is not amenable to this type of federated model.  The caDSR has not been designed in a fashion that would allow other organizations to deploy their own caDSR and have data flow between the instances.  MD Anderson is proposing to leverage and extend the cgMDR project in order to pilot federation of metadata management at their organization.

        This would facilitate a federated architecture such as this:

        See the VCDE:attached presentation for more information. All users of the semantic infrastructure would be effected by these requirements.
