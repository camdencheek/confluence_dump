        Summary of requirement pre-interview, by Reviewer:
      </td>
      <td>
        There is a distinct lack of and need for a metadata repository that can store information models in a way that they can easily be searched and visualized in a UML-centric manner.  Furthermore, this repository/interface should allow users to easily traverse between UML, ontologies, metadata, XML Schemas, and APIs, as well as begin searching and visualizing from each of these items.  The baseline use case is that users (Information Technologists) come to caBIG looking for ways to interoperate and/or build interoperable systems from different backgrounds/viewpoints.  This is especially true coming from the UML world (which is the lingua franca of software development), and there is no way to search and visualize information models in a UML visualized manner.
