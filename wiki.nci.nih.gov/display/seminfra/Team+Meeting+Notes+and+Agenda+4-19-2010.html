1.Update on ISO 11179
Our basic technical approach remains unchanged. ISO 11179 is not part of our requirements.

Q: Is &#34;value domain&#34; a 11179 term?
A: Yes, it is, but we can still use it as a domain for a particular property.

2.Update on caEHR

Dave Hau has been assigned with ca EHR ( = cancer Electronic Health Record). This week we will find out more about it and whether or not there might be another analyst involved on the caEHR side, or whether one of our analysts will take on the caEHR use cases.

3.Simple User Stories

We reviewed and discussed the following two pages:
<ul>
  <li>
    Patrick&#39;s simple user stories :
    <a href="https://wiki.nci.nih.gov/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=25005755" rel="nofollow">
      User Story Drafts
    </a>
  </li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>
    Rick&#39;s matrix with list of user stories and what  functional profiles they address:
    <a href="https://wiki.nci.nih.gov/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=63996330" rel="nofollow">
      Semantic Infrastructure Services User Story Matrix
    </a>
  </li>
</ul>
The idea is that user story titles from the second link will link to  user stories in format as displayed in the first link.

Each user story has three parts to it: Domain Description, Technical Description, and Cross Reference.

User stories need to be reviewed and if possible further consolidated to come up with the shortest list of use cases which will cover all of Initiative 1 requirements. Those will be pesented to leadership and then entered into the matrix by Alan Blair (Second link above) with an &#34;x&#34; in the appropriate column of functional profile that is addressed in the user stories.

Baris will take on the domain description for workflow/ pipeline.

For traceability each user story has a list of links to requirements from the master list in its &#34;cross reference&#34; section.

3.a.Presentation to leadership

The domain stories are fit for presentation to members of CBIIT leadership.

3.b.Preparation for software developers

The matrix is for internal use of the team to easily keep track of which user story covers with functional profile.
