  Meeting Minutes
</h2>
1. Review and discussion of revised questionnaire templates
Bea split and adjusted the requirement gathering template according to input from the Requirement Analysts (Hua, Baris, Shantanu) that has been collected during previous meetings and through their written feedback on each item. There are two draft templates which could be posted as usable templates by Ann Wiley, once approved by team. We reviewed as a group and Shantanu would like to review it further during the week and will get back to group with comments or questions next week.
Two changes were noted that Bea will implement this week (see action items).

2. Presentation of use cases by business analysts Mohamed and Shantanu
Mohamed did not join our meeting today, so that we canceled the exchange of information (presenting use cases to each other) that we had planned here.

3. Denise points out that we need to refine and flesh out categorization of all topics.

She will take a stab at it in mind-mapping software.

4. Rick Kiefer needs more information on a list of names that has been added to the master list.

Denise will provide this week. (refer to action items)
