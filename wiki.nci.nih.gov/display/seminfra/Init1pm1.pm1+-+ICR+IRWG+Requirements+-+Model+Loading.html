      </th>
      <td>
        Since its inception, caBIG has been founded on (1) developing and defining standards, tooling, and architecture to enable interoperability, and (2) determining whether existing systems meet the basic requirements for interoperability.  While the nature of the &#34;compatibility reviews&#34; may change, there is a clear need to provide the community a way to understand at what level different applications meet interoperability requirements.  It is highly desirable that the review process be as simple and transparent as possible both for the developer/owner of a system and the reviewers.  In this way, review artifacts should be able to be generated in an automated fashion based on the model itself or its registration in the metadata repository.  Furthermore, a reviewer using the compatibility review software should be able to access real-time the artifacts that they need to perform a review.

        It should not be a requirement to use the caBIG-defined tooling to generate compatibility artifacts.  Instead, there should be an alternate flow that involves the creation of the artifacts de novo, registration of the metadata, and providing the artifacts to the review system.

      <td>
        The modeling tool and metadata registry should facilitate easy reuse of existing metadata.  Specifically, this includes sophisticated/seamless type-ahead functionality for finding common data elements and semantic concepts, the metadata repository should support the notion of common data elements that overlap between system and provide touch-points for interoperability, the registration process should be linked directly with the modeling tool, and Information Modelers should have the ability to perform metadata loads into a &#34;sandbox&#34; metadata repository on their own.
