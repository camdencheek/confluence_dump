        Summary of requirement pre-interview, by Reviewer:
      </td>
      <td>
        The new semantics infrastructure should provide for interoperation with external research communities depending upon semantically aware networks. As an example, a means to provide bidirectional, semantically aware access to data available in the caGrid and in the SHRINE network used by CTSA should be provided to the members of each community. Ontological resources or other architectural components of the new semantics infrastructure should anticipate the need to support data sharing frameworks providing access to external communities that desire access to caBIG resources, while providing caBIG participants with access to resources on the network&#39;s supporting external communities.  These requirements primarily will effect all consumers of the semantic metadata, including Information Technologists, Cancer Researchers, and Metadata Specialists.
