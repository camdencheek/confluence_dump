      </th>
      <td>
        An information modeler needs to be able to begin recording semantics the of the information model automatically from the moment he begins his design. He needs to be able to find existing content or register new content, deriving the semantics needed for registration from his model throughout the development of the information modeling process capturing changes and recording then automatically as he edits the model.

        - Information modeler has a documented end user scenario for which he needs to develop a information model.  - He has access to an information modeling tool such as Enterprise Architect and intends to create a UML Model for use with his application.  - He has access to existing content in the semantic infrastructure.

        1. Modeler opens his modeling tool to begin designing his information model   2. Modeler creates and names new classes in his diagram   3. Modeler creates and names the associations between classes in the diagram   4. Modeler compares his design to the requirements   5. Modeler saves the design in the repository.  6. Modeler retrieves the model to conducts a review with stakeholders and makes changes to the model.  7. Changes are saved in the repository.  8. Modeler marks the model as final and passes the model to the application developer to begin implementation.

        Fit criterion/Acceptance Criterion   How would actor describe the acceptable usage scenarios for the software or service that meets the actor&#39;s requirement?

      <td>
        1. A new model can be developed and the system finds a prior version, allows the modeler to reuse it.  2. A model is retrieved, edited and saved, the system keeps track of the differences between each version.  3. A different information modeler is able to find the specific information model that is associated with a specific use case.
