Semantic Infrastructure Forms User Story 3
Extend allowable answers with additional permitted values
<h2 id="SemanticInfrastructureFormsUserStory3-DomainDescription">
  Domain Description
</h2>
In many cases, data elements can be reused but the allowable values need to be extended or restricted. For example, one researcher may want to capture diseases of the nervous system while another may want to capture diseases of the cirulatory system. These both can be captured in the same data element (disease) using the same controlled terminology (ICD-9). However, the list of allowable values is quite different.  Furthermore, yet another researcher may want to focus only on certain circulatory diseases, such as those of the heart.  A metadata specialist can sit with a domain specialist to identify the appropriate ontologies and constrain or expand them as needed.
<h2 id="SemanticInfrastructureFormsUserStory3-TechnicalDescription">
  Technical Description
</h2>
The metadata repository allows for data element to have a value domain referencing an external terminology. Furthermore, those terminologies can be constrained or expanded as needed in the local repository.
