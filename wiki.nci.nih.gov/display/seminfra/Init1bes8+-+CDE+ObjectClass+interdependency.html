        Summary of requirement pre-interview, by Reviewer:

      <td>
        Business Goal: Removing current data element related constraints from information models
        Actor: Information Specialist (Modeler)
        Currently CDEs are bound to an object class which hinders reuse for developers. Although this supports domain information modeling, where classes actually represent real life entities, it does not support non-domain information modeling (e.g. summary classes, report classes that combine many attributes from different domain classes). Supporting such non-domain modeling practices and removing object class/DE dependency will be needed.

      </td>
      <td>
        Follow-up interview.
        Although requirement in clear,an interview may reveal alternative ways of handling the issue.  For instance the interviewee can suggest a mechanism that will be support &#34;trace&#34;/map any model entity (e.g. summary/report classes) back to a &#34;domain analysis model&#34;(or other) entities during registration.
