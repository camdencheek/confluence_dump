        Summary of requirement pre-interview, by Reviewer:
      </td>
      <td>
        The creation of metadata is currently a manual iterative process that involves many discussions, emails, and decisions between the Metadata Modeler and Metadata Curator.  This process can occur in the timespan of days or weeks, and complex metadata can involve many modifications and loadings during that time.  It is highly desirable that there is a mechanism to track these discussions, decisions, and changes over time.  This will provide traceability, as well as a controlled way to review the history of changes for all artifacts involved in compatibility review.
