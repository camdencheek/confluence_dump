        Summary of requirement pre-interview, by Reviewer:
      </td>
      <td>
        Actor: Information Specialist  Business Goal: To find/discover reusable metadata from knowledge/model repositories   Information specialist uses an new integrated tool/browser (or a enhance version of existing ones) to browse metadata that should have following functionality:   1. Show timestamps as to when CDEs were created at and when they were released (change status etc.) Possibly a version control/revision history functionality added to metadata browser.  2. Show level of reuse as such as who else in knowledge repository has used a set or a particular CDE or how often it&#39;s been used and by whom.  3. Show the version of the domain model loaded into knowledge repository in the tree structure.  4. Switch between different views of the metadata in a user friendly manner. For instance without opening two browsers one for CDEs (e.g. CDE Browser in current architecture) and Class/Attributes (e.g. UML Model browser in current architecture)

        Hello, my name is NAME. I am calling you today because NCI and caBIG are working toward a new and improved version of the semantic infrastructure to better support integration scenarios.  Our first step was to organize requirements collected over the past year. Your organization has expressed a requirement/need for BRIEF STATEMENT OF USER REQUIREMENT.  This has been identified as potentially a critical component to support application/data and service integration, and we need more information in order to enable us to meet this requirement. Do you have about 30 minutes to talk about this?

      <td>
        Yes.

        Do you have any solution integration needs? If so, what are they? Have you envisioned new ways of interacting with existing or new parts of the semantic  infrastructure?  (prompt to elicit changes/new ways of using the infrastructure)
      </td>
      <td>
        I anticipate there will be a browser (or browsers) that will interact with knowledge and model repositories.   Browsers should support different search mechanisms:   - Concepts based searches. The concepts used for annotating model components should be able to used for searching  -  Boolean searches using concepts   - Boolean searches using keywords  -  Keyword/free text searches   - Google-like (Intuative) vocabulary to support advanced searches. (e.g. object class: gene  or enumeration: liver) .   Browser should support search against all levels of metadata and alll administered components. (e.g. object class name or public identifier, developer definition, class name etc.). During the search invocation browser should provide auto-complete function or suggestions in search box (e.g. as soon as you type a letter of few it will show options) .   Browser(or browsers) should retrieve and show:  -  Metrics such as who else uses it, how many users, how many times used. This will enhance reuse. The more it is used the better to reuse it.  The metric will  help modelers to identify the reusable components. It will prevent modeling the same thing in slightly different way.  Effective discovery/search will be supported by these metrics.  - Timestamps such how long it has been around  - Status of data element/model components (e.g. released/draft new)  - Project versions that reused the data elements or model components. This could be in the tree structure like in current CDE browser.   -  Data  element version  -  Contact (e.g email, postal address) for the model/data element owner   Browser (or browsers) should be able to sort the elements based on the items listed above.     Browser (or browsers) should support switching between model and data element view easily. Browser(s) should allow download of the corresponding model (or the pieces relevant to the data element) with a click of a button you should be able to download the corresponding model (or the pieces relevant to the CDE). Browser should be able to provide graphical (not only textual) view of model components tied to data elements.  When model components are downloaded the user should be provided the option of downloading full inheritance structure (if exists) of the component.    Browser should support mechanisms to &#34;watch&#34; data elements or model components and if desired alert interested parties about changes.

        Information specialist&#39;s use of metadata browsers as part of their modeling effort; possibly a starting point.  Tighter data element/model centric view integration.  Support for ranking based on metrics/status/data element version/status.

        Yes. Browsers, SIW, Curation Tool, Admin Tool   Not user friendly. Too many tools serving similar purposes. Certain functionalities are only available in some so you need to know all for effective use. Most functionalites can be combined under one tool.  Rigid/static result pages.

      </td>

        Alternative solution I can think of involves a lot of manual work and using multiple tools. This leads to potential misses, lack of reuse and poor modeling.

        Should work.  Performance should be acceptable; model should be accessible in no time.  Search results should return most valid model components/data elements at the first page (effective ranking)  If not results found it should say the search is conducted but no matches found (e.g. SIW is cryptic)  Watch/alert should alert promptly as metadata changes.  Auto-complete function provides an informative list.
