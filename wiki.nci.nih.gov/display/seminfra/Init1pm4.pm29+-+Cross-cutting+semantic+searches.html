        Brief Description
      </th>
      <td>
        Using Natural Language Processing and integrating both the terminology service and the metadata service APIs or similar future services, create a discovery service/tool which exposes data elements not based on the Names stored in the metadata repository but by using query in a concept search and pulling associated metadata to match. This would enable construction of better search algorithms and serve as a potentially better discovery entry point for the user not familiar with the metadata standard nomenclature.  The primary users that this would serve include both Cancer Researchers and Information Technologists.

        The query should provide more relevant results and be easier for non-technical users to construct than simple text-based matching.
