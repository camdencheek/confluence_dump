        Business Goal: Provide session-less, intitutive and direct links (URLs) to CDEs or modeling components.
        Actor: Information Technologist and/or Metadata Specialist
        On knowlegbase or model repository browser web pages provide a &#34;Link&#34; link that you can click on to easily get the link to the current page (see Google Maps for an example).  This will allow easy sharing of the CDE/Model centric information and enhance access to CDEs/modeling components as they are registered in knowledgbase and/or model repositories.
