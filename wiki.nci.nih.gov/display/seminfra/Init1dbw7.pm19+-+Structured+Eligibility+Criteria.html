        Structured eligibility criteria allows for data to be evaluated against standard criteria in the form of a CDE to determine eligibility to a clinical trial.  For example, the eligibility criteria may be that the subject must be male and the structured criteria would be gender equals male.  This can be represented as a CDE with an operator and value, e.g. age &gt;= 21.
