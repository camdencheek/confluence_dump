        Summary of requirement pre-interview, by Reviewer:
      </td>
      <td>
        (The Primary actor is Information technologist.)

        A) A system should be able to find and map semantically similar CDEs this will reduce redundancy.
        B)  More metadata needs to assigned to these entities: 1) associations in UML models 2) Complex data types 3) End-Point References 4) Services 5) Processes and/or algorithms 6) Workflows, for discovery and advertisement on the grid 7) Data provenance 8) Dynamic events, so that data or processes can be qualified with temporal states
        C) Services exposed on the grid should provide metadata about          1) Contact person 2) downtime/uptime/maintanence time 3) limitations
        4) point of contact&#39;s email, phone number/fax number.
        D) Analytical services exposed on the grid in addition to metadata enumerated in &#39;C&#39; (above) should give a high level info about the algorithms and description of domains and subdomains it serves
        E) Analytical services have a very short shelf life and are frequently remodelled. A more efficient way needs to be devised that will make registration of new metadata and reuse of CDE a more efficient process.
        F) Metadata regarding End Point References should be supported and made available on the semantic infrastructure to make invoking EPR more user friendly.
        The primary business goal for these requirements is to make the services on grid more efficient and user friendly.
