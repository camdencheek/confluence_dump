        The materials and methods section of a paper contains a rich set of information about how an experiment as run, the types of data produced, etc.  This information can be encoded using semantic metadata, e.g. steps, datatypes, materials, equipment, etc.

        Once a materials and methods section of a paper is encoded semantically, it is discoverable semantically.  Users can identify the experiments and approaches that can be applied to their type of data, and then potentially even export the steps as a programmatically executable workflow.
