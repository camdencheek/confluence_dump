        --&gt; In general to cut the time in model load process:
        - Centralizing/harmonizing tools to access metadata (Currently there is
        quite a lot of tools with very related functions)

        - Streamlining model load and/or metadata curation for developers so
        that they can do it themselves (not necessarily a production level load)
        -Empower Developers to load their own model in a staging area and decide when they are
        Ready to move it to production
        <ul>
          <li>
            Streamline annotation of the model process:
          </li>
          <li>
            Allow users to point to various vocabularies (not only NCI-T)
          </li>
          <li>
            Allow users to create their own concepts and allow immediate
            consumption (not necessarily a production level creation; it can be staged)
            Allow new concepts to be sketched to meet an immediate need so user can
            Annotate his model - its available through another vocabulary - should let him annotate the model
            Without assigning the concept code (just need a description) - the loader would identify the new concept and
            Semi-automatically create the concept and attach to the model that suggested it. Allows the terminologists to
            see the use of the concept in context and either replace it or create a unique identifier for the new concept.

            In general to improve metadata reuse (model/data element/function)
          </li>
          <li>
            Allow users to compare their models with other models (Tejas)
          </li>
          <li>
            Provide users &#34;already annotated&#34; standard models for direct use
            (ensure DE-centric standards are modelable)

            - Develop tool(s) to conduct effective (e.g. sorting based on level of
            reuse, relation to DAM CDE/DEs/Object classes), powerful (e.g. free
            text, hierarchical (using annotations)) metadata searches (metrics that
            define &#34;best&#34;)
          </li>
          <li>
            Develop tools to export formats consumable by model authoring tools
          </li>
          <li>
            Allow developers to discover and cherry pick the parts/portions from different
            models (or CDE based) to incorporate to their models
          </li>
          <li>
            Could be a business model, not just the information model
          </li>
          <li>
            Provide direct access to metadata repository from model authoring tools
          </li>
          <li>
            Ensure consistency among different representations of metadata (DE, model, XSD etc)
          </li>
          <li>
            Train developers for the new tools; develop scenario-based training modules (e.g. how a LS/CTMS modeler can create a model conformant)
            - Test conformance of messages to standard message schemas(e.g. HL7 v2)
            - Allow developers to provide metadata around functions/methods/interfaces
            In general to support fast/easy development:
            - Provide ISO 21090 libraries for different languages
            - Provide SDKs for development, supporting
            - ISO datatypes
            - ORM
            - API (messaging or object based) generation for different languages
            - Provide specification templates
            (Business/Information/Computational/Engineering VPs) for ECCF viewpoints
            (The templates can accommodate extraction of computable specifications
            from business artifacts) - Provide a library of conformance profiles and search capability along
            with so that people can &#34;reuse&#34; in their specifications and/or write
            conformance statements accordingly
            In general to support &#34;computable&#34; interoperability
            - Support computable &#34;collaboration specifications&#34; that can be realized
            as transformation services/methods as needed
            - Support automatic generation of transformation services (this will
            require conformance to std. messages HL7v2/3)
