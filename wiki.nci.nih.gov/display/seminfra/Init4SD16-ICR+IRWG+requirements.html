        Summary of requirement pre-interview, by Reviewer:
      </td>
      <td>
        The Primary Actor is a cancer researcher looking for data of his interest on the Grid:
        1. There should be a universal, single touchpoint querying technique for data across the grid instead of having to call multiple different methods.( My understanding is that this is how it is implemented currently on the production grid. Need to touch base with Bob to get more details.)
        2. More service metadata should be made available when exposing a service on the grid. (this requirement coincides with the requirement posted in Init1SD20;please refer)

        3. Metrics pertaining to usage of services should be available that will rate each service based on multiple parameters
        The over arching business goal of this requirements is to make querying more efficient and user friendly. This coincides with the some of the stated requirements in InitSD20
