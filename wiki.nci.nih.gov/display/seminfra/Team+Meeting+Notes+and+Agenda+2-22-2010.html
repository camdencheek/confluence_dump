AGENDA ITEM 1. Review prioritized Use Cases with each Business Analysts

2. TCGA
Meeting took place on Tuesday 2/16 and another follow-up meeting will be scheduled.

3. Requirement sharing (Sue Dubman)
Shantanu sent his formal requirement statement to Sue Dubman for validation the week before last.

Shantanu hasn&#39;t heard back yet. Shantanu will forward the reminder email with attachment to Denise Warzel on Tuesday 2/23/2010.

Mohamed:
The following two items are on same priority level:

1. caB2B

Mohamed received feedback from Mukesh on use cases and on the priority level of each use case.

Mohamed explored presenting use cases in visual format using &#34;BizAgi Process Modeler&#34; and Enterprise Architect-7.5.

He created a workflow diagram for &#34;Load Value Meaning&#34; use case and its related ones (alternatives), and the corresponding UML use cases. The group discussed how to attach it to the use case wiki page using the &#34;attachment&#34; tab. The visual presentation is very helpful in addition to the written out use cases.

2. Forms

The medidata meeting that was planned for last week was canceled.

AGENDA ITEM  2. Master List clean-up

Throughout the updates we went over how and where to post use cases and their attachments.
