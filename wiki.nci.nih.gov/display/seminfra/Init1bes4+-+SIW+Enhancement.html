      </td>
      <td>
        Enhance the Semantic Integration Workbench to allow application developers to validate their model against an existing standard supported by caBIG (e.g. NPO, CDISC, HL7, etc.). This will assist in determining the models&#39; level of support for the standard and verify touchpoints.  Different types of support for vocabulary, message and data element standards needed.

        Hello, my name is NAME. I am calling you today because NCI and caBIG are working toward a new and improved version of the semantic infrastructure to better support integration scenarios.  Our first step was to organize requirements collected over the past year. Your organization has expressed a requirement/need for BRIEF STATEMENT OF USER REQUIREMENT.  This has been identified as potentially a critical component to support application/data and service integration, and we need more information in order to enable us to meet this requirement. Do you have about 30 minutes to talk about this?
      </td>
      <td>
        Yes.

      <td>
        Do you have any solution integration needs? If so, what are they? Have you envisioned new ways of interacting with existing or new parts of the semantic  infrastructure?  (prompt to elicit changes/new ways of using the infrastructure)
      </td>
      <td>
        We would like to have a tool that will to assist in mapping the information model (class, attributes, and permissable values) to specific terminology/ontologies from one or many terminology services.  Unlike current SIW, which allows you to map model components against all NCI-T, works against one instance of EVS and provides only XMI as an output, we would like to be able to:  -  restrict the mapping to certain terminologies and/or different levels of hierarchies in terminology/ontology  -  use one more multiple instances of terminology services available  -  generate a table of the model component-matched concepts (in Excel and/or CSV formats)  This will identify gaps in the information model in terms of concept coverage (e.g. the concepts that are not covered by model but covered by ontology).     We would like to have the tool (could be the same one with above) to assist in mapping the information model to the domain analysis models (DAMs) or platform independent models and or platform specific models from model repository (or knowledge repository).  This could assist in verifying compliance and/or identifying extensions to the DAM or other models.  Automating compliance/conformance process at information model level and simplying it through tooling  would be great.

        The process of mapping a model to &#34;right&#34; concepts from &#34;right&#34; terminology/ontology will require cleaning to remove false-positives which is a labor-intensive task.    Identifying the relationship between different levels of models PIM-&gt;DAM for verifying the conformance/compliance will be a mostly manual task.

        The performance of terminology services should support fast real-time access to reading full/partial subtrees of terminologies/ontologies.   The addition of new concepts to NCI-T could be streamlined by providing a service that allows submission of new concepts for harmonization/creation upon EVS curator review.

        When an information model is mapped to a certain terminology and/or different levels of hierarchies in a terminology/ontology, all the concepts mapped should be from the target set.  When an information model is mapped to a DAM/PSM, all the common classes (entities) and attributes should be returned/provided.
