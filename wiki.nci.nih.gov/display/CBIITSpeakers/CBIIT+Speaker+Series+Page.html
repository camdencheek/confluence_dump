  Welcome to the CBIIT Speaker Series Wiki
</h2>
The NCI Center for Biomedical Informatics and Information Technology (CBIIT) Speaker Series presents talks from innovators in the research and informatics community. The biweekly presentations allow thought leaders to share their work and discuss trends across a diverse set of domains and interests. The goals of the Speaker Series are: to share leading edge research; to inform the community of new tools, trends, and ideas; to inspire innovation; and to provide a forum from which new collaborations can begin.Speakers represent many different institutions, and the topics they address are wide-ranging.

Over the past 15 years, our group at the Dana-Farber/Harvard Cancer Center (DF/HCC) has built an evolving oncology clinical trials imaging informatics platform, Precision Imaging Metrics. This platform was built by and for the DF/HCC Tumor Imaging Metrics Core to manage the workflow, image assessments, communication, reporting, billing, and compliance needs of our cancer center and is currently used as a CCSG shared resource to manage over 1,000 active DF/HCC clinical trials and over 15,000 time point assessments per year, with turnaround time as fast as one hour after the scan.  This software has been implemented at seven NCI-designated Cancer Centers around the country to improve clinical trials imaging assessment quality, compliance, and efficiency.  NCI funding has been critical in the development and evolution of this software platform: a variety of grant mechanisms (CCSG, ITCR U24, SBIR, AIP) have supported our efforts in various ways as the project has grown and matured. This presentation will summarize the phases of the project and the ways NCI funding has supported us throughout the product life cycle.

Natural language processing (NLP) applied to unstructured text of patient records can assist in codifying data elements.  We will describe the portability and reusability of NLP queries across institutions, introducing a technique called &#34;Iterative Interactive Enrichment&#34; to optimize identification of discrete data points within pathology reports for Non-Hodgkin&#39;s Lymphoma (NHL) patients.

A major barrier to the conduct of biomedical research is how difficult it is to share biomedical research data, both within and between institutions. Data located in different data repositories are almost always organized, categorized, and represented in different ways. This problem has been referred to as “the Chasm of Semantic Despair.”  In an attempt to address this problem, the Cancer Informatics group at the NCI, in collaboration with their colleagues at the FDA, ISO, HL7, and CDISC, developed a new international standard data model for biomedical research called the Biomedical Research Integrated Domain Group (BRIDG) model.  The purpose of the BRIDG model is to “bridge” the large number of Chasms of Semantic despair that exist both within and between academic medical centers, pharmaceutical companies, and government regulators. The Sidney Kimmel Cancer Center at Thomas Jefferson University in Philadelphia, has successfully designed and implemented a cancer research information system based on the NCI-BRIDG model. In this talk. Dr. Klumpp will describe how the BRIDG model has been implemented in the cancer research information system at Thomas Jefferson and the benefits of such an integrated system.
