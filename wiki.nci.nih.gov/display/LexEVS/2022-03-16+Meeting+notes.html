  Notes
</h2>
Attendees: Mark Benson, Lyubov, Cory, Tracy, Scott
<ul>
  <li>
    Reports should do the following:
  </li>
  <li>
    Run reports at any time (ad hoc)
  </li>
  <li>
    Monthly reports
  </li>
  <li>
    Ability to compare January to February statistics (or any given months)
  </li>
  <li>
    Ability to do comparisons as needed
  </li>
</ul>
Metrics roughly the ones shown during our demo including:
<ul>
  <li>
    Define a time period to compare
  </li>
  <li>
    Number of visits
  </li>
  <li>
    Number of visitors from different URL
  </li>
  <li>
    All parameters by the tool should be available monthly
  </li>
  <li>
    Example: From June – July, what are the number of visits
  </li>
</ul>
Proposed:   Mayo team to create reports and show them in a couple of weeks.    The reports will be created in spreadsheets   Our team will work from feedback.   To be defined:    List of people receiving reports    Location of reportsUser should be able to dynamically create reports.  (If this is a requirement, and needs to be done outside of Sumo Logic, we may need to discuss a development cycle for a new application including asking for extended Sumo support for working through their API)
