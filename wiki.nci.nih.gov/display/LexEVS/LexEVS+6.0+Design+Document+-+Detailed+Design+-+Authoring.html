LexEVS API and the LexGrid model have been designed to provide capabilities to make changes to the terminology elements such as code system or value sets. However, the current LexGrid architecture and model is based on the premise that the information being provided is valid and consistent and is not designed to support partially formed artifacts such as concepts without associated codes, associations that have a source but no target, etc.
The LexEVS authoring tasks assumes that there is an external authoring tool that persists partially formed content and performs the necessary validation and reasoning tasks prior to their being incrementally loaded into the LexEVS services. We see this as being a necessary separation, as the potential combination of editors, reasoners, terminology models, etc. is almost limitless, and each of these will have its own requirements when it comes to completeness and validity.

LexGrid model entries like &#39;source&#39;, &#39;usageContext&#39;, etc which are not versionable, can also be modified but only in context with its parent entry. And also, any values to these attributes will be totally replacing the existing values.

For example, if a coded concept &#39;abc&#39; has a source &#39;company A, company B&#39; and if the source &#39;company B&#39; needs to be replaced by &#39;company C&#39; but keep &#39;company A&#39; as it is, we will need to pass in both source &#39;company A, company C&#39; within concept &#39;abc&#39; and have the changeType as &#39;MODIFY&#39; for this concept.

LexEVS Authoring API can accept changes to the terminology contents only in the form of:
<ul>
  <li>
    LexGrid java objects, OR
  </li>
  <li>
    XML file in LexGrid format.
  </li>

<h2 id="LexEVS6.0DesignDocumentDetailedDesignAuthoring-LexEVSAuthoringprocess">
  LexEVS Authoring process
</h2>
Important: Before the changed terminology content is sent to LexEVS Authoring API to process, the client application should make sure that the contents are valid.
<ul>
  <li>
    The contents should either be in LexGrid XML format or a LexGrid java object.
  </li>
  <li>
    The entry level for the changed contents should be at either systemRelease or revision level.
  </li>
  <li>
    The input format will be validated against LexGrid schema for compliance. If validation fails, exception will be thrown.
  </li>
  <li>
    Each change request in the revision package is validated sequentially. Each individual request validation will be performed based on the premise that all requests that precede it have been applied (e.g. if there are two change requests, one to create a new coding scheme and the second to create a new entity for the coding scheme, the new entity request is validated on the assumption that the coding scheme has been created. The service may validate the entire revision or it may cease validation at any point after an error is detected - this is up to the service provider.
  </li>
  <li>
    If no errors are detected in previous step, the change package is submitted to the business rules &#34;hook&#34;, which can apply additional validation, logging and error checking. If the business rules hook returns an error, no further processing is done and the result is returned to the submitter.
  </li>
  <li>
    If the submission passed step two, the complete set of changes will be applied to the service. If, for any reason, an error occurs, such as a network failure, a database failure, etc., the entire revision will be rolled back. Otherwise, the set of changes will be committed.
  </li>
</ul>
The intent of the change requests are as follows:
<ul>
  <li>
    NEW - to create a new versionable element
  </li>
  <li>
    MODIFY - to change the attributes of an existing versionable element
  </li>
  <li>
    VERSIONABLE - to change (or schedule a change of) the status of a versionable element within the context of the containing service.
  </li>
  <li>
    REMOVE - to remove a versionable element from the service. (Note that VERSIONABLE Retire should be used if the element and its history should remain)
  </li>
  <li>
    DEPENDENT - no changes are to be made to the named element itself, but a versionable element whose identity is dependent upon this element is to undergo a change.
  </li>
</ul>

  Querying data based on version information
</h2>
LexEVS Authoring API provides ability to query terminology content based on:
<ul>
  <li>
    revision identifier
  </li>
  <li>
    specific date and time
  </li>
</ul>
<h3 id="LexEVS6.0DesignDocumentDetailedDesignAuthoring-Querydatabasedonrevisionidentifier">
  Query data based on revision identifier
</h3>
This allows users to get the state of an entity like concept code, coding scheme, pick list, etc, at the given revision.
Exception will be thrown if the revision identifier was not found in the system.
And if that entity (ex concept code) had no changes for that particular revision, the API will return the state of that entity when that revision was applied to the system.

Example of query based on revision identifier
<img alt="illustration of query based on revision identifier" src="https://wiki.nci.nih.gov/download/attachments/embedded-page/LexEVS/LexEVS%206.0%20Design%20Document%20-%20Detailed%20Design%20-%20Authoring/revisionRevisionIdBasedExample.jpg?api=v2">
In the above example, coding scheme &#39;CS1&#39; is revised in 4 different instances R1, R2, R3 and R4 at respective dates. The query API will be able to provide the states of the versionable elements at different revisions. Example, API will be able to return the state of concept &#39;C1&#39; at revision R2.
<h3 id="LexEVS6.0DesignDocumentDetailedDesignAuthoring-Querydatabasedonspecificdateandtime">

This allows users to get the state of an entity like concept code, coding scheme, pick list etc, at the give date and time.
Exception will be thrown if no data was found for given date and time.

  CTS 2 Authoring profile:
</h2>
The CTS2 SFM calls for the ability to create, maintain and update code systems, concepts, and associations as separate entities. The LexGrid and LexEVS model views all three of them as aspects of code systems, and its incremental revision approach allows any or all of them to be changed as a single unit. The LexEVS model also subsumes the notion of a &#34;code system supplement&#34;, as a collection of one or more revisions to a code system can be packaged as a &#34;system release&#34;, with its own provenance, activation dates, etc., and can be applied to external code systems independently.

The Terminology Authoring Profile is intended to provide the capability to robustly query and access terminology content, as well as directly modify the terminology content. This includes the ability to modify code system content, value set content, as well as the metadata pertaining to each. This profile includes the functions necessary to administer and search terminology content as outlined in the CTS2 Query Profile as well as the Terminology Administration Profile.
