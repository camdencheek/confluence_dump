        Lucene difficulties have to do with different searches when querying different levels of items. We search Entity differently than when we do it&#39;s propertiesAmazon has an open source fork of ES called OpenSearchThe browsers have eliminated the lucene searching, not sure what types of searches the browser itself is using against LexEVS.Â  There is concern that lucene is insecure so a refactor may be needed soon.
