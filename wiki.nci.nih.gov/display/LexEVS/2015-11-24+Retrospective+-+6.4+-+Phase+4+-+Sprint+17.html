  What did we do well?
</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    All committed stories were completed within the Sprint.
  </li>
  <li>
    Exit Criteria was well documented and satisfied.
  </li>
  <li>
    Logging of hours is better this Sprint - but still no good way to review hours logged for tasks/person.
  </li>
  <li>
    Team did well despite travel and competing activities.
  </li>
</ul>
<h3 id="id-20151124Retrospective6.4Phase4Sprint17-Whatshouldwehavedonebetter?">
  What should we have done better?
</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    When estimating the sprint (hours) we need to include and consider admin time (sprint planning), PTO, and then 7/1 work time.
  </li>
  <li>
    Need to determine how to get better/more efficient responses from NCI.
  </li>
  <li>
    For tasks that need to have NCI review, do not include that step in the exit criteria. Â This will be outside of our tasks.
  </li>
