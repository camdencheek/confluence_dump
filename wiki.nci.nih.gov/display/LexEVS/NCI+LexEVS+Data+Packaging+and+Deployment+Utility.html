  NCI LexEVS Data Packaging and Deployment Utility
</h2>
The NCI LexEVS Data Packaging and Deployment Utility is primarily intended to ease the manual process of packing and publishing LexEVS 5.1 data from environment to environment (environment here refers to software development tiers such as Quality Assurance). In general, LexEVS 5.1 data is loaded in to a LexEVS 5.1 environment using the LexEVS 5.1 loader and using the LexEVS Data Packaging and Deployment utility it is possible to package the loaded data for deployment and to then to deploy said data to other LexEVS 5.1 environments. Updates of the associated &#34;metadata.xml&#34;, &#34;registry.xml&#34; and Lucene index files are handled automatically by this utility.  This utility will also handle the removal of selected terminologies from target environments.
<h2 id="NCILexEVSDataPackagingandDeploymentUtility-UsageInformation">
  Usage Information
</h2>
The NCI LexEVS Data Packaging and Deployment Utility contains two separate executable files, the first one being &#34;package.sh&#34; which invokes a Java executable which is able to process user packaging commands (an instruction set) for the purpose of creating a &#34;deployment&#34; package. The user is able to select which terminologies are to be deployed and which terminologies are to be removed using the &#34;package.sh&#34; utility. The second, &#34;deploy.sh&#34; invokes a Java executable that is able to read the previously created package and to deploy it to a target environment.
<h3 id="NCILexEVSDataPackagingandDeploymentUtility-TechnicalOverview">
  Technical Overview
</h3>
The NCI LexEVS Data Packaging and Deployment Utility is written as a Java command line application following the standard Unix command line syntax and base on NCI BDA-Lite. NCI BDA-Lite is a light weight application build and deployment library enabling developers to easily incorporate common software development tasks such as application server configuration and web application deployment via custom Apache Ant Task(s). In addition, the BDA-Lite Java API allows developers to execute deployment tasks outside of the Apache Ant environment via plain Java applications such as with the NCI LexEVS Data Packaging and Deployment Utility.

Below is a listing of the instruction set for both the packaging and deployment utilities:

        The following &#34;target_name_#&#34; properties can be repeated for each web application that needs to be stopped/started after a data deployment. To uniquely identify server properties, target names are appended by a &#39;_#&#39; where &#39;#&#39; is an integer value from 0 to 9 to indicating the server number.
        Example;

        target_url_0=http://localhost:8080/mylexapplication/

  Stopping/starting Jboss
</h3>
JBoss servers are stopped/started via SSH by invoking the JBoss start_jboss and stop_jboss scripts (as defined in deploy.properties). Up to 10 JBoss servers can be stopped and started this way.
(Stopping/starting of application servers can be disabled using &#39;-r&#39; option on deploy.sh)
<h3 id="NCILexEVSDataPackagingandDeploymentUtility-CheckingifJbosshasstarted">
  Checking if Jboss has started

The deploy app checks the web applications JBoss URL to see if it has started. See
