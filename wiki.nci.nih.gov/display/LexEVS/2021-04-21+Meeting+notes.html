            Meeting with Natalia, who is handling caDSR to MDR migration. Any questions I should put to her?
            <ul>
              <li>
                Where is MDR getting its EVS data? the EVS file dump for NCIt
              </li>
              <li>
                What vocabularies does it use?  Just NCIt, for now.
              </li>
              <li>
                Expected lifespan of caDSR?
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    Curation tool will shut down in ~August, when MDR goes up.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    SIW will stay up and that uses EVS.  That provides files to UML Loader but that has no loader to MDR yet. Still unclear of future or scheduling
                  </li>

                Is query that was breaking working now. Vikram working on it and doesn&#39;t think it has to do with communication with EVS. Not 100% reproducible. Huge biomarker Value Domain with 5000 objects attached to it.
