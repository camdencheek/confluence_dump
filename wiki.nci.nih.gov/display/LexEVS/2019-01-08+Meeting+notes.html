        Last discussion we chatted structure and said it might need a database to store hierarchies of indexes.  Any more thoughts?  Could this be stored itself in TS or does it need relational?For very specific use case of resolving large hierarchies - graph databases are best. Some other types of queries are very fast - Kevin has been working with Arango and OSQL. Calls itself a &#34;multi-model&#34; database.
