  What should we have done better?
</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    Fell short when planning the sprint and not fully considering the reduction of Cory&#39;s time to complete tasks.
  </li>
  <li>
    Need to put less in sprint when we have unknown availability.
  </li>
  <li>
    Better to pull things from Sprint when you realize things will not be complete.
  </li>
  <li>
    Provide better scoped stories (make the stories smaller)
  </li>
  <li>
    When working on a story and you realize there are other changes to be made, capture in another story. Â  Keep the commits limited to the specific story.
  </li>
  <li>
    When creating a story, capture the exit criteria so we know if a story is complete or not.
  </li>
</ul>
