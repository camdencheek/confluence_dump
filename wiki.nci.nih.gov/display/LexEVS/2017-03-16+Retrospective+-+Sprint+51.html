  What did we do well?
</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    OWL2 loader performance enhancements are good.  This should help when loading at NCI.
  </li>
  <li>
    Issues around tree and OBO were handled and completed even given a shortened sprint.
  </li>
</ul>

  What should we have done better?
</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    There were many issues brought up that were not  LexEVS issues.  Most were configuration issues.  NCI is unwilling to use the tooling provided in some cases and this causes the team to spend extra time not planned.  The LexEVS team needs to address this by better communication and a new attempt at simplifying things.
  </li>
  <li>
    Team needs to once again focus on Agile processes and make sure backlog is updated, all tasks are represented.
  </li>
  <li>
    Better understand the exit criteria of issues before work begins.
  </li>
</ul>
