  Current LexEVS REST Service Architecture
</h2>
LexEVS has a resource oriented REST service available for traversing ontologies.  This implementation has been built on the
<a href="http://www.omg.org/spec/CTS2/1.2/" rel="nofollow">
  CTS2 standard
</a>
.The REST service is located here:

  Background
</h2>
As customers are transitioning from the retired caCORE API to the CTS2 REST service, they have asked how to retrieve terminology concepts in a similar way that the did previously in caCORE.  This has raised some concerns in the differences they have encountered when using the CTS2 REST service.  Previous caCORE API calls were able to retrieve the resource they wanted with one call.  It was also able to retrieve the specific component that they requested.Based on these concerns, there were several JIRA items that have been submitted, requesting enhancements to the CTS2 REST service.We have provided a brief analysis of if the issues based on the following:
<ul>
  <li>
    Is this currently supported in CTS2?
  </li>
  <li>
    If the our implementation of CTS2 can handle the request, but it hasn&#39;t been implemented yet.
  </li>
  <li>
    This is outside of the CTS2 specification.
  </li>
</ul>

Going forward, we will need to determine what best fits NCI&#39;s needs for a LexEVS REST service.In order to do this, the team will need to:
<ul>
  <li>
    Determine the audience - who are the users.
  </li>
  <li>
    Understand the technical requirements/limitations.
  </li>
  <li>
    Understand the functional requirements.
  </li>
</ul>
