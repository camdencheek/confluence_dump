  Introduction
</h2>
This section provides requirements, instructions, and troubleshooting information for installing a LexEVS Local Runtime.
<h2 id="id-3InstallingLexEVS6.xLocalRuntime-Preliminaryconsiderations">
  Preliminary considerations
</h2>
BEFORE YOU BEGINLexEVS has been tested with the operating systems and hardware specified in the
<a href="https://wiki.nci.nih.gov/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=62427336" rel="nofollow">
  supported platforms
</a>
. While LexEVS is expected to run on many variations of hardware and software similar to the test platforms, results cannot be guaranteed. Before you begin you should check to make sure that your platform will support the software.
<ul>
  <li>
    There are a number of
    <a href="https://wiki.nci.nih.gov/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=62427336" rel="nofollow">
      prerequisite software products
    </a>
    that you must install to run a LexEVS Local Runtime on your platform. You must make sure that you have the proper software and versions, depending on which LexEVS environment you are installing. Do this now, for the Local Runtime designated prerequisite software, before continuing to the install steps.
  </li>
  <li>
    As an option you may consider the command line install of a LexEVS Local Runtime for putting all the necessary files in place based on a pre-decided list of components to include. As noted in the last step of the GUI Installer for LexEVS Local Runtime, you can save a file that represents the choices you have made during the GUI install. This file can be used as-is or be edited and then fed into an install on another server. Follow the
    <a href="https://wiki.nci.nih.gov/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=62427333" rel="nofollow">
      steps for installing a LexEVS Local Runtime using the optional command line method
    </a>
    if you should choose this route.
  </li>
  <li>
    Complete the

      Downloading and Installing the LexEVS Local Runtime
    </a>
    steps.
  </li>
</ul>
Once you have completed the prerequisite software install, the Local Runtime environment install steps, and the verification test as described in this guide then you should be ready to start programming using the API to meet the needs of your application. Not counting prerequisite software products the installation and verification should not take more than 60 minutes.

        1. Download the latest version of the Local Runtime GUI install package from the right. The location you have chosen to save this on your computer will be referred to as the SAVE_DIRECTORY. Examples will use scratch as the directory.NoteIf you plan to install LexEVS Distributed or the LexEVS Grid Services then you must install matching versions in conjunction with the Local Runtime.NoteAccess to the downloads does not require an account. If you are having trouble downloading files then you may need to disable pop-up blockers or check any firewall settings at your site.

        1. Configure Database Management System properties   We provide an example of a MySQL configuration to optimize a database for LexEVS.NoteIt is considered beyond the scope of these install instructions to address database setup and administration. However, proper database configuration is critical to the performance and long-term health of the LexEVS environment. System administrators should consult the MySQL documentation to determine settings that are appropriate to the host machine and environment. Tuning should be performed prior to loading vocabularies. At a minimum, users must create a target database (see the next step) on the database server and provide user credentials for creating, deleting, and writing to tables.

        The lbconfig.props file has the latest documentation embedded inside of it. lbconfig.props should be considered authoritative if there is a difference between the documentation written here and that contained in lbconfig.props. You may open that file now and use the documentation within it to configure LexEVS. The following link describes all of the property settings available for configuring LexEVS. It may have additional descriptive information beyond that found within lbconfig.props. It is useful but not necessary to a successful install.

        5. Set DB_PRIMARY_KEY_STRATEGY   Take extra care to consider this parameter in the configuration file. The value for the parameter may not be optimal for loading terminologies. You must change its value before any LexEVS operations. Once there have been any operations you can not reset this parameter without deleting the database and recreating it.

  Testing the LexEVS Local Runtime
</h2>
This Local Runtime installation provides a test suite to verify the environment. Before running these tests the Local Runtime and databases must already be configured.

        2. In a command prompt window change to the test directory:   cd {LEXEVS_HOME}\test   Run the TestRunner utility to start the test process:   &gt; TestRunner.{ext} -v   where {ext} is the extension appropriate for your operating system (bat for Windows, sh for Unix)  Windows example:
        TestRunner.bat -v
        Unix example:
        ./TestRunner.sh -v
        NoteThe image shows the start of the test. If you use the Java runtime rather than the Java SDK at this point it will complain about tools.jar. Other debug errors may show up but these are just warnings.

        3. Each test section should have [OK] printed after it. If so then that test passed. If you see [FAIL] after a test then you will need to look into the error. When it says BUILD SUCCESSFUL at the end this simply means that the test script ran to the end.

If all the tests pass then you have successfully installed the LexEVS Local Runtime. Congratulations!NoteThe other options for this test script run a very large set of jUnits. The use of these is documented in the script comments. Not recommended for most users.

  Troubleshooting
</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    If you use a space in the name of the path to install LexEVS, that is LEXEVS_HOME, you might get errors from the underlying database during runtime. It it highly recommended that you do not use a space in the path.
  </li>
  <li>
    Upgrading LexEVS may require reloading content. Be sure to read the release notes for each LexEVS release before installing the latest version. Preserve configuration files and indexes unless instructed to reload or do otherwise in the release notes. These files include lbconfig.props, registry.xml and the entire lbIndex directory in the resources directory. Note that the names of those last two files can be altered by variables in the lbconfig.props file.
  </li>
  <li>
    LexEVS loads of content are generally handled in a robust manner. Failed loads clean up after themselves relatively well when database management systems are properly configured to allow database drop functions by LexEVS. However, exiting the application in the middle of a load may cause unpredictable results. Errors will be detected for some loads and they will be listed as PENDING in any API call to the coding scheme metadata. They can be removed if this is the case, and the user can restart the load.
    <ul>
      <li>
        Other steps may need to be taken if this doesn&#39;t work, including dropping databases as the DBA, deleting the index file for the offending terminology, and editing the registry.xml and metadata.xml files by hand.
      </li>
      <li>
        A quick, dirty solution is to drop all databases and delete all configuration files except lbconfig.props.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    Know when to scale database management systems for management of large terminologies. Administrators who load very large terminologies, such as the NCI Metathesaurus in single table mode, will experience very long delays while the deletion process completes.
  </li>
  <li>
    LexEVS is no longer distributed with a Java MySQL driver due to licensing concerns. If LexEVS reports an error concerning establishing a connection to the MySQL server yet the MySQL command line interface is able to connect, an adjustment in the version of Connector/J may be required.
    <ul>
      <li>
        The latest version of Connector/J is available from MySQL.org. The new jar should be placed in the {LEXEVS_HOME}/runtime/sqlDrivers/ directory. If you are changing drivers remove the existing driver jar file to ensure that the class loader does not incorrectly load the older driver file.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    If the user experiences slow performance with MySQL when loading or accessing terminologies then a review of the suggested configuration parameters for the database management system is recommended. Pay particular attention to the MySQL values.
  </li>
</ul>
