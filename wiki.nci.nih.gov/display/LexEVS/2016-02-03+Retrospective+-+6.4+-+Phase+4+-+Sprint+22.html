      <li>
        Started the sprint with reasonable Story Points.
      </li>
      <li>
        Completed more story points than expected.
      </li>
      <li>
        Well planned stories and exit criteria.
      </li>
      <li>
        Order of tasks was important - led to other tasks getting complete due to previously resolved tasks.
      </li>
      <li>
        Team was good at testing, merging testing bug fix branches. (manual CI process)
      </li>

<h3 id="id-20160203Retrospective6.4Phase4Sprint22-Whatshouldwehavedonebetter?">
  What should we have done better?
</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    Miscommunication about adding mapping issue
  </li>
  <li>
    Scope of performance task was much larger than expected.    This led to us not completing the user story.  (for example - should have had setup user story (configuring, loading content) and then performance execution user story and then finally a performance result/documentation story.)
