  Asserted Value Sets In LexEVS
</h1>
Asserted Value Sets are not a formal model element in LexEVS.  There is no asserted value set object to instantiate, instead these value set representations are expressed directly in the terminology and represented in ways similar to LexEVS models of Value Set Definitions and Coding Schemes.

  Value Sets Asserted In The NCI Thesaurus
</h2>
Value Sets have been asserted directly in the NCI Thesaurus by creating a set of properties and relationships within the original OWL file to describe a &#34;top node,&#34; and a set of related values associated with that node.

The &#34;top node&#34; is a representation of an OWL class that defines a set of properties, which provide human readable metadata about what this classification of values means.

This node, the OWL defined relationships that point to it, and a set of properties key to defining aspects of a value set, allow LexEVS to adequately define this, both in terms of a Value Set Definition, and also as a Coding Scheme object.  The API&#39;s that work in conjunction with the externally defined value set definitions and resolved value set coding schemes can receive these objects transparently because they are the same type as previously defined for the legacy API.  Since these Objects have been adequately defined elsewhere in this documentation set, we won&#39;t redefine them here.
