Goals:
<ul>
  <li>
    Better understand the struggles and issues associated to loading value sets.   Once those are identified, understand the actual requirements.
  </li>
  <li>
    Once requirements are agreed upon, propose solutions to satisfy them.
  </li>
</ul>

        Review Value Set workflow process (Tracy and Rob)
        <ul>
          <li>
            The goal is to identify the areas of the workflow that cause the greatest issues. (for example, long load time for 700 value sets)

        Discussion Points:
        <ul>
          <li>
            What are the requirements for resolving value sets?
            <ul>
              <li>
                Performance parameters?
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            Rob mentioned there are 760 resolved value sets - loaded over the weekend.  Last one took about 2.5 days.
            <ul>
              <li>
                This is run once a month.
              </li>
              <li>
                Is there a simpler/quicker way to resolve these value sets?
              </li>
              <li>
                Better logging would help to determine if there were any failures for resolving the value sets.
              </li>
              <li>
                Rob suggested that if the script ran over night, this would be acceptable.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            Scott mentioned we could make the value sets transitive.  This would make loading resolved values sets perform better.
          </li>
          <li>
            Rob questioned if we can load multiple values in parallel.
          </li>
          <li>
            Kim asked if we need to resolve all of these value sets every month.
            <ul>
              <li>
                Produce a large OWL file that contains entities with the value sets.
              </li>
              <li>
                This file needs value set membership information.
              </li>
              <li>
                Can search against this large file.
              </li>
              <li>
                This is all in the LexEVS environment.
              </li>
              <li>
                Kim would need a convenient API method to generate this output file.
              </li>
              <li>
                There are a few value sets that are not from NCI Thesaurus.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            We will need to verify that the value sets are consistent from the current method of generating them to any new method of creating them.
          </li>
          <li>
            Tracy mentioned that most value sets (about 700 of them) are concept in subset.  The hierarchy of the targets are about 2 levels deep.
          </li>
          <li>
            Most of the value sets can be built off from the information in the NCI Thesaurus.
          </li>
        </ul>
        Decision Points:
        <ul>
          <li>
            Requirements
            <ul>
              <li>
                Ability to audit and simplify the workflow.
              </li>
              <li>
                Better logging to help determine if there were any failures for resolving the 760 value sets.
              </li>
              <li>
                Rob suggested that if the script ran over night, this would be acceptable.
              </li>
              <li>
                Ability to quickly resolve value sets on the fly.
              </li>
