The following information was designed to give an overview of the functionality contained within the Lexical Grid Enterprise Vocabulary Services (LexEVS). As a beginner or experienced terminology user you will find this information useful when choosing if the LexEVS services are right for your institution or application.Each area of LexEVS is broken down with its primary value proposition and additional items for you to consider. Note: LexEVS 6.4.1.2 has been released and includes fix for an issue found in the LexEVS codingSchemeReference method.  For more information on LexEVS 6.4.1.2, see
