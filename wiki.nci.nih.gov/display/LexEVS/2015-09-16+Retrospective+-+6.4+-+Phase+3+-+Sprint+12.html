  What did we do well?
</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    Did a good job completing support issues.
  </li>
  <li>
    We were able to manage what work was to be worked on and completed while developers were out.
  </li>
</ul>

  What should we have done better?
</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    We should create story (not subtask) if we need to investigate a feature/story.
  </li>
  <li>
    Git comments should start with the parent/story JIRA issue number, not the JIRA subtask issue number.
  </li>
</ul>
