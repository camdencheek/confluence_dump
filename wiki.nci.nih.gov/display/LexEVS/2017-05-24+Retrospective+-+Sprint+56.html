  What should we have done better?
</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    OWL2 fix did impact our Sprint - should have addressed the Sprint task sooner.
  </li>
  <li>
    VS architecture and requirements should have had better definition and clarity.  Team should have more rigorously investigated and capture the requirements.
