There are some commands that we have found useful in the MySQL environment. You can investigate this database software more at the
<a href="http://dev.mysql.com/doc/" rel="nofollow">
  MySQL web site
</a>
.Creating a database within the software can be done via the command line. The target database should be created with a default character set encoding of UTF-8. First log in as the MySQL user with create, write, update and delete permissions. This could be &#34;root&#34; that you created during the install of MySQL or another user you have created since then.
<ul>
  <li>
    mysql -u {username} -p{password} Then create a new target database that uses UTF-8 as the default character set.
  </li>
  <li>
    mysql&gt; CREATE DATABASE {DBNAME} CHARACTER SET utf8 COLLATE utf8_general_ci; ...where DBNAME is the name of your database needed for LexEVS to store data in.
  </li>
</ul>
To see that you have indeed created a database you can see them listed with this command:
<ul>
  <li>
    mysql&gt; show databases
  </li>
</ul>
If you have root or administrator access to your server you can change the password for the root user ID if you have forgotten or lost it.
<ul>
  <li>
    mysqladmin -u root password {mypassword} ...where mypasswordis your new passwordNoteMySQL can be passed a JDBC option for the Windows local environment that may improve perfomance 30 to 50%.
  </li>
</ul>
Try the following values in the lbconfig.props file for the DB_URL:DB_URL=jdbc:mysql:///{DBNAME}?socketFactory=com.mysql.jdbc.NamedPipeSocketFactoryThis uses Windows Named Pipe function and avoids use of the TCP/IP protocol. It only works when connecting with a local iteration of the MySQL database on Windows.
