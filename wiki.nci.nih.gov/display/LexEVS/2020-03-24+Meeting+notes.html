        origin issue = iterator count not accurate and no good way to fix within LexEVS and relational databaseNow have a graph database and created new node graph resolution to work with it. Can&#39;t easily adjust old CNG due to caDSR dependencies. New NGR not accepted by Kim.Legacy LexEVS probably not structured in a way to allow new module solutions.Jason raised idea of what LexEVS contract can handle with external work.

But we originally only had an NCIt vision. Brian adjusted so we can expand.Need to pull in Brian with Mayo to get a picture.Challenge on how to handle indexes, etc. Technical discussions need to occur.Possibly next week at 1PM ET?
