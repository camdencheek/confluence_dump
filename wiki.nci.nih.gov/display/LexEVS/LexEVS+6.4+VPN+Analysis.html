The purpose of this page is to compare the results we found from testing both the site-to-site VPN and the software VPN.  To do this, we connected to both VPNs at random times over the course of a week and performed X window forwarding of the Eclipse IDE and a browser window.  We recorded the response time it took for multiple tasks to complete including a button click, text entry, window resize, and highlighting a table row.

            If it had not crashed on class create, Eclipse Juno would still have had usability issues when with an unacceptable time delay on one occasion.
          </li>
          <li>
            Other factors add to overall usability including consistently slow wizard window start up and long delays in right click menus.  None of these are quite as bad as text entry lag.
          </li>
          <li>
            Jittery text entry is irritating in the java editor, but it&#39;s still usable
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        Eclipse neon did not crash and never showed the unacceptable text entry time delay of Eclipse Juno.  Hard to tell if that was application or network related.

Site to Site is slower, more prone to unacceptable time delays and much less flexible than software VPN.
