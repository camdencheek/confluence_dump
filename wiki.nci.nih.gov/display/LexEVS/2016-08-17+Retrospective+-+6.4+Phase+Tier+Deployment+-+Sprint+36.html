  What should we have done better?
</h3>
<ul>
  <li>
    Release management with NCI - getting NCI to commit to release strategy a struggle.
  </li>
  <li>
    Requirements for Tech Stack were not realistic in their environment. Â The Mayo team was able to deliver a release to support CentOS7 and Java 8 and HTTPS, but NCI is not able to support this environment.
  </li>
  <li>
    Management of stories needs to be precise and include only what the story requires.
  </li>
</ul>
