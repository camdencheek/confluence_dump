      LexGrid Model and Schema
    </a>
    The LexGrid Model is the underlying informational model used to store terminological metadata. It is Mayo Clinic&#39;s proposal for standard storage of controlled vocabularies and ontologies. The model defines how vocabularies should be formatted and represented programmatically, and is intended to be flexible enough to accurately represent a wide variety of vocabularies and other lexically-based resources.
