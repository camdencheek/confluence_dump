ISO 21090 Datatypes (Analytical Services)

Consideration will be given to the use of ISO 21090 data types as mandated for use in analytical services. It is important to note that (a) guidance concerning data type translations is not yet in place and (b) CBIIT has not fully defined the approved 21090 types to be used in services. Additionally, the LexEVS API is large and complicated and it would be cost and time prohibitive to consider such a huge effort. Hence, we intend to leave existing interfaces and functionality of LexEVS as is for LexEVS 6.0. We will plan a pilot implementation that consists of a defined set of core methods (focused around the HL7 specific portion of the model) wrapped by services that utilize the ISO 21090 data types. This will allow us to explore how data type transformations might be done and identify any effect on performance. Furthermore, the pilot will provide data and experience that could be used to provide feedback to NCI regarding the evolving ECCF process.
