        Model Clarification
      </td>

        Enhancement Request
      </td>
      <td>
        There are several issues that have made the model difficult to explain, implement, and use.  These issues include:
        <ul>
          <li>
            The inconsistent use of names - some core data types begin with &#34;ts&#34; and others don&#39;t.
          </li>
          <li>
            Naming confusion - &#34;URN&#34; is used in several places where the data type should be a URI, labels say &#34;id&#34; when they mean &#34;code&#34;, etc.
          </li>
          <li>
            Inconsistent typing - localId is used as a type throughout much of the model instead of specifying the particular domain (e.g. source, language, namespace name, etc)
          </li>
          <li>
            Inconsistent use of the &#34;any&#34; type - it has a misleading label in the builtins section (tsCaseSensitiveDirectoryString), and then isn&#39;t used consistently through the model.
          </li>
          <li>
            While we aren&#39;t yet resorting to relaxNG, we would like the XML validation to catch more obvious errors.  Weak typing prevents some of this validation, but setting minLength to &#34;1&#34; on fields that are expected to have content will reduce the number of XML documents that validate but don&#39;t load correctly

      <td>
        The 2008/01 model supports a fixed set of entity types - concept, relation and instance.  While this aligns with OWL/DL, it doesn&#39;t account for (a) terminologies that haven&#39;t differentiated classes from individuals, (b) OWL Full, where an entity can be both a class and an individual and (c) other type systems, such as that supported by KTMI
      </td>
      <td>
        Made &#34;entity&#34; a first class class, that included all properties and characteristics.  Added an optional, repeating entityType field which allowed the entity to be classified, added supportedEntityType in the mappings to allow types to be customized, removed the fixed enumeration of types and added constraints that define &#34;concept&#34;, &#34;instance&#34; and &#34;relation&#34; by the entityType field

        LexGrid needs the ability to version and activate changes on the property, entity, association instance, pick list, pick list entry level in addition to the concept level.  Each of these entities need to support a status, state (active or inactive) the date/time when the change is to become active, the data/time when it is to become inactive, and additional metadata about who, how and why the change should be applied.

            Provided an optional link from versionable to an entryState record that carried the type of change and the revision that this change was included in.

        The namespace used to qualify the URI of a coded entity isn&#39;t necessarily the namespace of the coding scheme making an assertion about the entity.  These two elements are convoluted in the current LexGrid model.
      </td>
      <td>
        Added a new localId type, &#34;NamespaceName&#34; and a new mapping, &#34;supportedNamespace&#34;.  Changed the codingSchemeId attribute of &#34;entity&#34; to entityCodeNamespace, which references a supportedNamespace. If entityCodeNamespace is present, it references a supportedNamespace, which, in turn, has an attribute, &#34;equivalentCodingScheme&#34;, which has the local name of the codingScheme that corresponds to the entityCodeNamespace

        The value domain model needs to be extended to support the definitions represented in the IHC model.

The model of pick lists need to be extended accordingly to meet multiple GE/IHC requirements

        RDF based loaders transform triples into a combination of (a) first class attributes (e.g. entityDescription, copyRight, presentation, definition, ...) (b) generic lexical properties or (c) relations.  Properties and relations preserve the original RDF type, but the first class attributes lose the information about where the resource was derived from.  In addition, there is no way to assign status and provenance information to the first class attributes (see: Refined History Model)
      </td>
      <td>
        Model philosophy was changed to have first class attributes represented in two forms: as an attribute and as a property that is identified as being an attribute.  To do this, we added new attributes to property and propertyQualifier that, if non-blank, stated the first class entity that this property (or propertyQualifier) represented.  As an example, the copyRight entity would also be represented as a property with a propertyType of &#34;copyRight&#34;

      <td>
        The 2008/01 model has two different &#34;mappings&#34; entities, one for codingScheme and one for valueDomain.  Each has a different collection of supported, and the order of the entries are confusing and arbitrary. With the addition of another &#34;mappings&#34; entry for pick list, we suggest that the three mappings be consolidated into one type, and the contents be alphabetized.  This will make code management and authoring easier. (second entry) It should be possible to enter a codingScheme, valueDomain or pickList without having any mappings entries and have the loader fill out the information of all of the localId&#39;s and, where possible, the URI&#39;s that they map to.  This should not be the function of an editor or type transformation package
      </td>
      <td>
        Created a new &#34;mappings&#34; entry in Naming package, removed the existing entries from codingScheme and valueDomain and pointed them at the new entry.  Alphabetized the entries and made them all optional.
