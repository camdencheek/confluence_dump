Goals We need to broaden the scope of and participation in this series, and at the same time sharpen the focus.
<ol>
  <li>
    LexEVS and CTS2 are planned to continue as key components of NCI terminology services, but NCI also plans to extend beyond them, notably with RDF triple store SPARQL and REST components.  This raises important design and coordination issues.
  </li>
  <li>
    REST services need substantial extensions, within and beyond CTS2.  NCI plans to offer REST APIs that can support the requirements of its own and others’ applications, and expects a significant component to be REST services from the RDF triple store.  An obvious test case is ability to support EVS browser functionality (even while these browsers will likely use the Java API for some time to come).
  </li>
  <li>
    We face some immediate needs from other users, notably CTRP and GDC, so need to clarify design approaches and produce new services based on them in the relatively near term.
  </li>
</ol>

            CTS2 Handling of namespace in read service. Could namespace be included as a parameter in a REST call?
            <ol>
              <li>
                entity read service is able to include namespace.
              </li>
              <li>
                Need to confirm the responses to determine both namespaces are supported for single concept code

              <li>
                CTS2 will no longer be running against remote (only local)

            Support for property and relationship search?
            <ol>
              <li>
                Need further notes on this.  Graph implementation should cover relationship search.  Properties are currently restricted to presentations, it may mean an extension to supply better coverage to generic property types.

            </ol>
          </li>
          <li>
            Constrained/restricted search (e.g., restrictToCode on CNS; search only on a particular branch of tree, for instance, Gene, Gene Product -- CTRP like use cases).

                Need to have ability to know if a node is expandable or not.

                This is provided in CTS2 response.
              </li>
              <li>
                This an identifier applied to a definition (IE)
                <ol>
                  <li>
                    A name for the definition.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    In this case, it can be anything to identify the version.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    The request is to resolve this identifier on the server rather than passing it back and forth between client and server. This would require an API change.

            Issues we face for Triplestore extension: Various OWL formats (e.g., in NCIt the unique idenfier is code, but in GO, it&#39;s oboInOWL:id)
            <ol>
              <li>
                CTS2 allows for many identifiers
