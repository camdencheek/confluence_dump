  System Overview
</h2>
The EVS Report Exporter is a Spring Boot/Vue.js application that makes EVS REST API calls to generate customizable reports of the EVS terminologies.  This application will allow EVS users to extract data out of the NCI Thesaurus (NCIt) triple store database through the EVS REST API. This application provides users a flexible way to download a selected subset of terminologies from NCI Thesaurus.   It may be required to make deeply recursive method calls requiring plenty of RAM type memory. It is expected to be hosted in a tomcat web application container behind an Apache reverse proxy. The expectation is that an NIH managed Amazon Web Service virtual machine will host the tomcat instance using a war file deployed from a Jenkins track as needed.The architecture will consist of Spring Boot Web Service with a node.js supported Vue.js U.I. The expectation is that this will be hosted on Tomcat with Spring Boot and Vue.js wrapped into the war file. If this isn’t possible we may need to use a node.js server to support the UI. No database will be required. We expect the service to have access the EVS API Rest Services which will provide data and API access for much of the functionality.

  Services
</h2>
The EVS Report Exporter services is a Spring Boot application that makes EVS REST API calls and possibly later make direct EVS Stardog DB SPARQL queries to generate customizable reports of the EVS terminologies.
<h2 id="EVSReportExporterFunctionalReqiurements-UserInterface">
  User Interface
</h2>
The EVS Report Exporter will have a web user interface to create different formats of reports to export.  These publicly accessed reports will contain user selected selected concepts and concept properties properties as well as the report format type.  Users will be able to select entities from the NCIt by entering entity codes into web page, select which properties of that entity to download, select a file format, and download as a file.  A user will be able to enter a list of entity codes or provide a top node of a hierarchy of nodes to resolve.  Hierarchies may be downloaded to a given depth which will be selected by the user up to and including resolving an entire hierarchy.
