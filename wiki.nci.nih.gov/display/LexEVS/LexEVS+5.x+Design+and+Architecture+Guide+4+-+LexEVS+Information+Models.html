  Information Models Overview
</h2>
The information below is provided for introductory purposes. A full description of all available model components is also available in the javadoc distributed with the LexEVS installation package (see file breakdown in the
<a href="https://wiki.nci.nih.gov/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=62427405" rel="nofollow">
  Installation Guide
</a>
). Since the javadoc is automatically generated and synchronized during the build process, it is recommended as the primary reference for use by LexEVS developers.
<h2 id="LexEVS5.xDesignandArchitectureGuide4LexEVSInformationModels-LexGridModel">
  LexGrid Model
</h2>
The LexGrid model is mastered in XML schema. The LexBIG project currently builds on the 2009 version of the LexGrid schema.  A formal representation, showing portions of this structure that are of primary interest to the LexEVS project, is presented below. A complete version of the model is available at

.
<h3 id="LexEVS5.xDesignandArchitectureGuide4LexEVSInformationModels-CodingSchemes">

Core components of interest include:

AbsoluteCodingSchemeVersionReference
An absolute reference to a coding scheme. This form of reference is service independent, as it doesn&#39;t depend on local coding schemes names or virtual tags.

AssociatedConcept
A concept reference that is the source or target of an association.

Association
The representation of a particular association as it appears in a CodedNode.

CodingSchemeSummary
Abbreviated list of information about a coding scheme.

CodingSchemeURNorName
Either a local name or the URN of a coding scheme. These two are differentiated syntactically - if the entity includes a colon, :, or a hash &#34;#&#34; it is assumed to be a URN. Otherwise it is assumed to be a local name.

CodingSchemeVersionOrTag
A named coding scheme version or a virtual tag (e.g. latest, production, etc). Note that the tagged form of identifier is only applicable in the context of a given service, as one service may identify the scheme as &#34;production&#34; and another as &#34;staging&#34;.

ConceptReference
A reference to a coding scheme and a concept code.

LogEntry
A single recorded log entry.

LogLevel
Indicates severity of the log entry.

MetadataProperty
Reference to a property name and value stored in the coding scheme metadata.

NameAndValue
A simple name/value pair.

ReferenceLink
Any reference to another document element.  Used by the REST architecture to embed links.

ResolvedConceptReference
A resolvable concept reference.

ServiceURL
References a service in the Globus environment, this will be a global service handle (GSH).

</h3>
Defines metadata related to model objects required by the runtime.

Describes a LexBIG sort module.

SortDescription
A description of a LexBIG extension module.

SortOption
