Below you will find an expanded overview of the options in this file. Options in BOLD must be modified so that LexEVS can properly use your database. They are also noted as required. There are many other options that you can change for performance reasons or alternative deployment scenarios, but you probably don&#39;t need to change them in a standard LexEVS installation. Some options can not be changed after you load terminologies into LexEVS. Now would be a good time to read about what is available to you.NoteA single back slash &#34;\&#34; is not valid within the lbconfig.props file for file or directory paths (except within JDBC connection strings). When constructing file or directory paths you must use either a forward slash &#34;/&#34; or two backward slashes.

      </td>
      <td>
        Required: The address of your database server. This will include the host name or IP address followed by the name of the database that you created to store LexEVS data. For example:
        DB_URL=jdbc:mysql://{hostname}/{DBNAME}

        ...where hostname is the name of your server or hostand DBNAME is the name of the database you created for LexEVS within your database software  hostname can also be an IP address hostname can also be followed by a colon and a port number in the case where you have multiple installs on the same server and have changed the port number that the database responds to. There are several options in the file as an example.

        DB_PREFIX
      </td>
      <td>
        The prefix to use on created tables.Warning If you are using Oracle, this is not supported because of length constraints on oracle table names so you must leave this value blank. On databases other than Oracle, there should be room for a reasonable (&lt; 10) amount of characters. This value MUST BE UNIQUE for each LexEVS runtime that uses the same database host. Do not use dashes - in the db_prefix value. Recommended characters are alphanumeric (a-z, 0-9) and underscore _. This variable should typically not be changed after content has been loaded.  The default is lb.

        DB_PRIMARY_KEY_STRATEGY
      </td>
      <td>
        Primary key strategy indicates which strategy will be used for the primary key of the database tables.Warning This cannot be changed after the initial schema installation. Allowable values include:
        <ul>
          <li>
            GUID Primary Keys are implemented as random GUIDs.
          </li>
          <li>
            SEQUENTIAL_INTEGER Primary Keys will be sequentially incremented as Integer values. Starting in 6.0.4 this is the default. Sequential Integer Primary Key (SEQUENTIAL_INTEGER) is the best strategy for large loads. This allows the database to insert records into the index in a sequential manner, which is more efficient. If the GUID strategy is used, records will be inserted into the index tree at random locations, resulting in index re-balancing after every insert.

        LG_CONFIG_FILE
      </td>
      <td>
        This is not actually a variable that you would set within this file. It is documented here for clarity of other variables that depend on this variable.  Normally, this variable is automatically set (at runtime) to the location of the lbconfig.props file that is being used by the runtime.  Alternatively, you can set the java system variable LG_CONFIG_FILE at system startup to point to the lbconfig.props  file that you want LexEVS to use. Refer to additional documentation in the lbconfig.props file if you need to use this feature.

      <td>
        This variable is the path that will be used to resolve any other relative (or unqualified) paths in the lbconfig.props file.  This variable is optional, and should usually be left blank.  If this variable is left blank, it will automatically be set (at runtime) to the location of the folder which contains the lbconfig.props  file that the system was started with.  This variable can also be overridden by setting the java system variable LG_BASE_PATH.  The default value is blank.

        LexEVS maintains a pool of connections to each database that it connects to. This sets the limit on the number  of connections that will be opened. You may want to set this to a higher value - 20 or so (depending on expected user load)  The default is 25.

        ERASE_LOGS_AFTER

If LOG_CHANGE is set to a number of MB then this variable specifies the number of old log files  that will be kept. The unit is treated as days regardless of the LOG_CHANGE value.  Cleanup will only occur on restart of the JVM.  The default is 5 files.
