Need to discuss a home for this (maybe not on EVS)- Loading logs - need to involve security team.Shiv to send email regarding logs to the security team (Craigâ€™s email).Shiv- For internal use - do we need on all 4 tiers?Cuong suggested: Dev, stage, prod- Still needs to go through all the same security (app scans)Scott will follow up with filling out the intake formArchitecture:Spring boot, tomcat/apache, Vue.js ELK (elastic search, beats, kabana, log stash)Access logs contain server IPs and client IPs.
