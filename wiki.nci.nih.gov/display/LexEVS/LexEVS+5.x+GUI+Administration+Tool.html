  Launching the GUI Administration Tool
</h2>
If you choose to install the LexEVS GUI when you installed LexEVS, you will have a gui folder inside of your LexEVS base installation.  If you installed the GUI for all operating systems, you should have the following programs:
<ul>
  <li>
    Linux_64-lbGUI.sh
  </li>
  <li>
    Linux-lbGUI.sh
  </li>
  <li>
    OSX-lbGUI.command
  </li>
  <li>
    Windows-lbGUI.bat
  </li>
  <li>
    Windows-lbGUI -browser.bat
  </li>
</ul>
We provide two Windows shell script versions which allow a choice between the full-fledged interface for loading, managing, and end-use, or the interface for end-use only.

This shell script provides an example by which any shell script can pass an argument option &#34;-d&#34; into the java command launching the LexEVS GUI application, restricting the end user to browsing only, and allowing no loading or management of terminologies.

Launch the GUI by executing the appropriate script for your platform.  You will be presented with an application that looks like the following figure:
<img alt="screenshot of the LexBIG UI" src="https://wiki.nci.nih.gov/download/attachments/embedded-page/LexEVS/LexEVS%205.x%20GUI%20Administration%20Tool/LexBIG_GUI.jpg?api=v2">
This application will let you perform most administrative functions that are available in the LexEVS API.  To enable the administrative functions, first go to the &#39;Commands&#39; menu, and then click on the &#39;Enable Admin Options&#39; submenu.  This will enable all of the commands that can make changes to the LexEVS environment.

This guide covers only the administrative commands. Refer to the LexEVS Programmer&#39;s Guide for instructions on using the rest of the LexEVS GUI.
