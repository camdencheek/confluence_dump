        Next generation of NCI Enterprise Vocabulary Services This version represents the next generation of NCI Enterprise Vocabulary Services. In this release, the LexBIG Java API and LexGrid model become the strategic EVS interfaces, replacing the legacy EVS API and EVS 3.2 model.
        <ul>
          <li>
            Complete shift from the EVS Model and EVS API to the LexBIG API and LexGrid Model. LexGrid Enterprise Vocabulary Services is now known as LexEVS.
          </li>
          <li>
            Introduces LexGrid-based QBE services.
          </li>
          <li>
            Consistent naming and release numbers for API and services.
          </li>
          <li>
            Unified OWL loader (Migration from the NCI OWL loader and a generic OWL loader to a single loader).
          </li>
          <li>
            The 2008/01 model is updated to the 2009/01 LexGrid Model.
          </li>
          <li>
            Optimized query execution (ability to place an arbitrary number of restrictions on a search request, which are automatically combined by the runtime when on node or graph resolution).
          </li>
          <li>
            Improved graph navigation (navigation of arbitrary relationships within a specific distance, uni or bi-directional navigation, ability to place multiple search restrictions based on association name or qualifier).
          </li>
          <li>
            Compared to the legacy EVS model, the LexGrid model is capable of representing additional ontology sources and/or semantics for some sources.
          </li>
          <li>
            Improved concept search (support of additional match algorithms, ability to place multiple search restrictions based on properties by type, name, value, or qualifier).
          </li>
          <li>
            LexEVS now offers a LexEVS data grid service in addition to the analytical grid service .

        Migration Path This version supports the EVS adapters through LexBIG but also introduces LexEVS API.
        <ul>
          <li>
            Represents a hybrid design, integrating components of legacy EVS architectures with LexGrid/LexBIG technologies. This allows the same vocabularies to be served in terms of the older EVS model (via pre-existing EVS APIs) or the LexGrid model (via the LexBIG API).
          </li>
          <li>
            The legacy EVS model and API have been formally deprecated in this release.
          </li>
          <li>
            Fundamental goal for the release is to provide a migration path that allows users to transition from the older/legacy EVS interfaces toward adoption of newer LexEVS interfaces (based on the LexGrid model and LexBIG API).
          </li>
          <li>
            Many EVS and LexGrid/LexBIG components are individually packaged, versioned, and installed. As the transition from the legacy EVS interfaces completes (in version 5.0), all packages will begin to carry the LexEVS name and abide by the same conventions for version numbering

        Robust vocabulary services This release provides a robust and scalable open source implementation of EVS-compliant vocabulary services.
        <ul>
          <li>
            The API specification is based on but not limited to fulfillment of the caCORE EVS API - The input/output parameters used by EVS API adapters. The specification also accommodates changes and requirements based on prioritized needs of the caBIG® community.
          </li>
          <li>
            Provides a flexible implementation for vocabulary storage and persistence, allowing for alternative mechanisms without impacting client applications or end users. Initial development will focus on delivery of open source freely available solutions, though this does not preclude the ability to introduce commercial solutions (e.g. Oracle).
          </li>
          <li>
            Provides standard tooling for load and distribution of vocabulary content. This includes but is not limited to support of standardized representations such as UMLS Rich Release Format (RRF), the OWL web ontology language, and Open Biomedical Ontologies (OBO).
          </li>
          <li>
            This model provides the core representation for all data managed and retrieved through the LexBIG system, and is rich enough to represent vocabularies provided in numerous source formats including:
            <ul>
              <li>
                Open Biomedical Ontologies (OBO)
              </li>
              <li>
                Web Ontology Language (OWL)
              </li>
              <li>
                Unified Medical Language System (UMLS) Rich Release Format (RRF)
              </li>
