This directory provides a centralized point for command line scripts that can be executed to perform administrative functions such as the loading, activation/deactivation, and removal of vocabulary resources.NoteProgrammers may be interested in the code used to execute these functions. In that light, it is perhaps noteworthy to mention that this directory does not contain any source or binary code, only the scripts used to launch the admin functions.Object code used to carry out these functions is included directly in the LexBIG runtime components. Source code is included in the /source directory in the lbAdmin-src.jar (described below).

It should, in general, be considered off-limits to modify or remove the content of this directory without specific guidance and reason to do so. Files typically stored to this location include the vocabulary registry (tracking certain metadata for installed content) and indexes used to facilitate query over the installed content. One file of particular interest in this directory is the /resources/config/config.props file.

This directory contains a Java archive (.jar) file containing the combined object code of the LexBIG runtime, LexBIG administrative interfaces, and any additional code they are dependent on. All required code for execution of LexBIG administrative and runtime services is installed to this directory.NoteJava programmers writing to the LexBIG runtime interfaces should always include the following files in their java classpath (listed in order of inclusion):
        <ul>
          <li>
            /runtime/lbPatch.jar - In the course of the product lifecycle, it is possible that smaller fixes will be introduced as a patch to the initially distributed runtime. Including this file in the classpath ensures automatic accessibility to the calling program without requiring adjustment. All patches are cumulative (there is at most one patch file introduced per release; all patch-level fixes are cumulative).
          </li>
          <li>
            /runtime/lbRuntime.jar - This is the standard runtime file, including all LexBIG and dependency code required for program execution except for SQL drivers (see next).

    <tr>
      <td>
        /runtime  /sqldrivers
      </td>
      <td>
        The JDBC drivers used to connect to database repositories are not included in the lbRuntime.jar. Instead, the runtime scans this directory for the drivers to include. This can be overridden by path settings in the config.props file.NoteWhile the LexBIG software package ships with JDBC drivers to certain open source databases such as mySQL and PostgreSQL, this folder provides a mechanism to introduce updated drivers or to add drivers for additional supported database systems. For example, the Oracle database is supported by the runtime environment. However, the drivers are not redistributed with the LexBIG software. To run against Oracle, an administrator would add a jar with the appropriate JDBC driver to this directory and then reference it in the config.props settings.

        Optionally installed. Due to license considerations for additional materials (as described by the license.pdf and license.txt files in the install directory), the cumulative runtime provided in the lbRuntime.jar is not redistributable. This directory contains a finer grain breakdown of object code into logical components and 3rd party inclusions. All components are redistributable under their own license agreements, which are provided along with each archive. The top-level of the /runtime-components directory contains all code produced for the LexBIG project in a single lexbig.jar file.NoteThese files are included as an alternative to the lbRuntime.jar for code execution and redistribution. There is no need to include any of these files in the Java classpath if you are already including the lbPatch.jar and lbRuntime.jar described above.

  A Simple Example
</h3>
This section describes the basic steps involved in writing and deploying a program that directly invokes the LexBIG Java software components.
<h4 id="LexBIG1.0.2Developer&#39;sTechnicalGuide-EstablishtheDevelopmentEnvironment">
  Establish the Development Environment
</h4>
Installation should first be performed to the host server according to procedures described in the LexBIG Administrator&#39;s Guide. After installation, developers may wish to copy the components required for program development to a local environment. Installed components of interest include the following:
<ul>
  <li>
    /runtime/lbRuntime.jar - This archive contains the combined code for all executable code, as described earlier in this section. Adding this file to the Java classpath during development will allow compilation of source code.
  </li>
  <li>
    /runtime-components/lexbig.jar - While this jar does not include all code required for runtime execution, it does provide a sufficient alternative to the lbRuntime.jar file for purposes of program compilation.
  </li>
  <li>
    /source/lb*.jar, lg*.jar - Contain the source code for the LexBIG interfaces. Many development environments (e.g. Eclipse) will provide the ability to link these files to the object code archives. This allows for improved reference materials during program development.
  </li>
</ul>
<h4 id="LexBIG1.0.2Developer&#39;sTechnicalGuide-WriteandCompilePrograms">
  Write and Compile Programs
</h4>
Example source is provided below for a simple program that lists the available coding schemes (containers for vocabulary concepts and relations) registered to a LexBIG server node:
import org.LexGrid.LexBIG.DataModel.Collections.CodingSchemeRenderingList;
import org.LexGrid.LexBIG.DataModel.InterfaceElements.CodingSchemeRendering;
import org.LexGrid.LexBIG.Impl.LexBIGServiceImpl;
import org.LexGrid.LexBIG.LexBIGService.LexBIGService;
import org.LexGrid.LexBIG.Utility.ObjectToString;

public class ListCodeSystems {
public static void main(String[] args) {
try {
LexBIGService lbs = new LexBIGServiceImpl();
CodingSchemeRenderingList schemes = lbs.getSupportedCodingSchemes();
for (CodingSchemeRendering csr
: schemes.getCodingSchemeRendering() )
System.out.printIn(

ObjectToString.toString(csr.getCodingSchemeSummary()));
} catch (Exception e) {
e.printStackTrace();
}

NoteSun Java Development Kit (JDK) level 5.0 or above is required for program development. The code base has not been updated to accommodate Java 6.
<h4 id="LexBIG1.0.2Developer&#39;sTechnicalGuide-DeployandRun">
  Deploy and Run
</h4>
Continuing the example above, the compiled ListCodeSystems.class file should be copied to the LexBIG server system for invocation. Currently LexBIG services are invoked through direct programmatic access, though future direction is to provide additional web or grid-level service invocation in support of multi-tier scenarios. Additional description of system components and deployment scenarios is provided in the section,

.As with development, program execution requires the Sun Java JDK (or JRE) version 5.0 or above. Assuming the Java command is accessible in the path and the ListCodeSystems class file is installed to a directory of choice {pgm-dir} and the LexBIG is installed to {lexbig-dir}, the program can be invoked through the following command line interface:
java -cp {lexbig-dir}/runtime/lbPatch.jar:{lexbig-dir}/runtime/lbRuntime.jar:{pgm-dir} ListCodeSystems
NoteThe above example uses syntax for a Linux installation; Windows users would use alternate syntax for file separator (&#39;\&#39;) and classpath separator (&#39;;&#39;).As mentioned previously, it is considered good practice for developers to include the lbPatch archive in their class path, as it is designed to introduce smaller fixes without requiring download and redeployment of the complete (and much larger) runtime jar.

  What is LexGrid?
</h4>
LexGrid is an initiative of the Mayo Clinic Division of Biomedical Informatics that focuses on the representation, storage, and dissemination of vocabularies. This effort centers on, but is not limited to, the domain of medical vocabularies and nomenclatures. Focal points of the LexGrid project include the development and promotion of standards, tools, and content that:
<ul>
  <li>
    Provide flexibility to represent yesterday&#39;s, today&#39;s and tomorrow&#39;s terminological resources using a single information model.
  </li>
  <li>
    Provide the ability for these resources to be published online, cross-linked, and indexed.
  </li>
  <li>
    Provide standardized building blocks and tools that allow applications and users to take advantage of the content where and when it is needed.
  </li>
  <li>
    Provide consistency and standardization required to support large-scale terminology adoption and use.
  </li>
</ul>
<h4 id="LexBIG1.0.2Developer&#39;sTechnicalGuide-WhatisLexBIG?">
  What is LexBIG?
</h4>
LexBIG is a more specific project that applies LexGrid vision and technologies to requirements of the caBIG® community. The goal of the project is to build a vocabulary server accessed through a well-structured application programming interface (API) capable of accessing and distributing vocabularies as commodity resources. The server is to be built using standards-based and commodity technologies. Primary objectives for the project include:
<ul>
  <li>
    Provide a robust and scalable open source implementation of EVS-compliant vocabulary services. The API specification will be based on but not limited to fulfillment of the caCORE EVS API. The specification will be further refined to accommodate changes and requirements based on prioritized needs of the caBIG® community.
  </li>
  <li>
    Provide a flexible implementation for vocabulary storage and persistence, allowing for alternative mechanisms without impacting client applications or end users. Initial development will focus on delivery of open source freely available solutions, though this does not preclude the ability to introduce commercial solutions (e.g. Oracle).
  </li>
  <li>
    Provide standard tooling for load and distribution of vocabulary content. This includes but is not limited to support of standardized representations such as UMLS Rich Release Format (RRF), the OWL web ontology language, and Open Biomedical Ontologies (OBO) .
  </li>
</ul>
The goal for the initial year of development was to achieve the Bronze level of compatibility with regard to the caBIG® requirements. Silver-level compatibility is being pursued.

  LexGrid Model
</h3>
<h4 id="LexBIG1.0.2Developer&#39;sTechnicalGuide-Overview.1">
  Overview
</h4>
The LexGrid Model is Mayo Clinic&#39;s proposal for standard storage of controlled vocabularies and ontologies. The LexGrid Model defines how vocabularies should be formatted and represented programmatically, and is intended to be flexible enough to accurately represent a wide variety of vocabularies and other lexically-based resources. The model also defines several different server storage mechanisms and a XML format. This model provides the core representation for all data managed and retrieved through the LexBIG system, and is now rich enough to represent vocabularies provided in numerous source formats such as OWL (NCI Thesaurus) and RRF (NCI MetaThesaurus).Once the vocabulary information is represented in a standardized format, it becomes possible to build common repositories to store vocabulary content and common programming interfaces and tools to access and manipulate that content. The LexBIG API developed for caBIG® is one such interface, and is described in additional detail in
<a href="https://wiki.nci.nih.gov/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=62427399" rel="nofollow">
  LexBIG APIs
</a>
.Following are some of the higher-level objects incorporated into the model definition:
<h4 id="LexBIG1.0.2Developer&#39;sTechnicalGuide-CodeSystems">
  Code Systems
</h4>
Each service defined to the LexGrid model can encapsulate the definition of one or more vocabularies. Each vocabulary is modeled as an individual code system, known as a codingScheme. Each scheme tracks information used to uniquely identify the code system, along with relevant metadata. The collection of all code systems defined to a service is encapsulated by a single codingSchemes container.
<h4 id="LexBIG1.0.2Developer&#39;sTechnicalGuide-Concepts">
  Concepts
</h4>
A code system may define zero or more coded concepts, encapsulated within a single container. A concept represents a coded entity (identified in the model as a concept) within a particular domain of discourse. Each concept is unique within the code system that defines it. To be valid, a concept must be qualified by at least one designation, represented in the model as a property. Each property is an attribute, facet, or some other characteristic that may represent or help define the intended meaning of the encapsulating concept. A concept may be the source for and/or the target of zero or more relationships. Relationships are described in more detail in a following section.
<h4 id="LexBIG1.0.2Developer&#39;sTechnicalGuide-Relations">
  Relations
</h4>
Each code system may define one or more containers to encapsulate relationships between concepts. Each named relationship (e.g. &#34;hasSubtype&#34; or &#34;hasPart&#34;) is represented as an association within the LexGrid model. Each relations container must define one or more association. The association definition may also further define the nature of the relationship in terms of transitivity, symmetry, reflexivity, forward and inverse names, etc. Multiple instances of each association can be defined, each of which provide a directed relationship between one source and one or more target concepts.Source and target concepts may be contained in the same code system as the association or another if explicitly identified. By default, all source and target concepts are resolved from the code system defining the association. The code system can be overridden by each specific association, relation source (associationInstance), or relation target (associationTarget).

The LexBIG vocabulary model extends the LexGrid model to provide unique constructs or granularity required by caBIG® that are not present in the core model. While many extensions exist, this document will focus on some of direct relevance to the high-level architecture.
<h4 id="LexBIG1.0.2Developer&#39;sTechnicalGuide-ConceptResolution">
  Concept Resolution
</h4>
LexBIG allows the service runtime to provide managed resolution of code-based objects that are referenced through LexBIG-specific lists and iterators (mechanism that allow streaming of list content). These lists and iterators are typically returned when requesting sets or graphs of vocabulary terms through the LexBIG API (described in
<a href="https://wiki.nci.nih.gov/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=62427399" rel="nofollow">
  LexBIG APIs
</a>
). Some model components involved in the resolution process include:
<ul>
  <li>
    ConceptReference - A globally unique reference to a concept code.
  </li>
  <li>
    ResolvedConceptReference - A concept reference for which additional information has been resolved, including description and relationship participation.
  </li>
  <li>
    AssociatedConcept - A concept reference that contains full detail in participation as a source or target of an association, including indications of navigability and qualification.

  LexBIG Services
</h3>
This section describes architectural detail for services provided by the LexBIG system. These services are geared toward the administration, management, and serving of vocabularies defined to the LexGrid/LexBIG information model. A system overview is provided, followed by a description of key subsystems and components. Each subsystem is described in terms of its overall structure, formal model, and specification of key public interfaces.

<h4 id="LexBIG1.0.2Developer&#39;sTechnicalGuide-Overview.3">
  Overview
</h4>
The LexBIG Service is designed to run standalone or as part of a larger network of services. It is comprised of four primary subsystems: Service Management, Service Metadata, Query Operations, and Extensions. The Service Manager provides administration control for loading a vocabulary and activating a service. The Service Metadata provides external clients with information about the vocabulary content (e.g. NCI Thesaurus) and appropriate licensing information. The Query Operations provide numerous functions for querying and traversing vocabulary content. Finally, the extensions component provides a mechanism to extend the specific service functions, such as Loaders, or re-wrap specific query operations into convenience methods. Primary points of interaction for programming include the following classes:
<ul>
  <li>
    LexBIGService - This interface provides centralized access to all LexBIG services.
  </li>
  <li>
    LexBIGServiceManager - The service manager provides a centralized access point for administrative functions, including write and update access for a service&#39;s content. For example, the service manager allows new coding schemes to be validated and loaded, existing coding schemes to be retired and removed, and the status of various coding schemes to be updated and changed.
  </li>
</ul>

The LexBIG architecture provides the underpinnings LexBIG services to be made accessible through the caGRID environment in the future, where LexBIG services might optionally be deployed in a caGRID Globus container. caGrid provides a Globus service for service registration and discovery. LexBIG services deployed to the grid would be registered in the NCICB registry and be searchable through the NCICB index service.

<h4 id="LexBIG1.0.2Developer&#39;sTechnicalGuide-Overview.5">
  Overview
</h4>
This subsystem provides administrative access to functions related to management and publication of LexBIG vocabularies. These functions are generally considered to be reserved for LexBIG administrators, with detailed instructions on how to secure and carry out related tasks described by the LexBIG Administrator&#39;s Guide.This subsystem is further broken down into the following components:
<ul>
  <li>
    Indexers- Vocabularies may be indexed to provide enhanced performance or query capabilities. Types of indexes incorporated into the LexBIG system include but are not limited to the following:
    <ul>
      <li>
        Lexical Match - for example, &#34;begins-with&#34; and &#34;contains&#34;
      </li>
      <li>
        Phonetic - allows for the ability to query based on &#34;sounds-like&#34; entry of search criteria.
      </li>
      <li>
        Stemming - allows for the ability to find lexical variations of search terms. Index creation is typically bundled into the load process. Architecturally speaking, however, this capability is decoupled and extensible.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    Loaders- Vocabularies may be imported to the system from a variety of accepted formats, including but not limited to:
    <ul>
      <li>
        LexGrid XML (LexBIG canonical format)
      </li>
      <li>
        NCI Thesaurus, provided in Web Ontology Language format (OWL)
      </li>
      <li>
        UMLS Rich Release format (RRF)
      </li>
      <li>
        Open Biomedical Ontologies format (OBO)
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
As with indexers, the load mechanism is designed to be extensible from an architectural standpoint. Additional loaders can be supported by the introduction of pluggable modules. Each module is implemented in the Java programming language according to a LexBIG-provided interface, and registered to the loader runtime environment.

<h4 id="LexBIG1.0.2Developer&#39;sTechnicalGuide-Overview.6">
  Overview
</h4>
This subsystem provides information about accessible vocabularies, related licensing/copyright information, and registration/discovery of LexBIG services.The ability to locate and resolve vocabulary metadata is fulfilled through the LexBIGService class. Metadata defined by the LexGrid information model is resolved with each CodingScheme instance. Available metadata on each resolved scheme includes, but is not necessarily limited to, the following:
<ul>
  <li>
    License or copyright information
  </li>
  <li>
    Supported values (e.g. supported concept status, language, property names, etc)
  </li>
  <li>
    Mappings from names used locally to globally unique URNs
  </li>
</ul>
In addition, each LexBIGService provides a centralized metadata index that allows registration and query of code system metadata without requiring resolution of individual CodingSchemes. This metadata index is optionally populated, typically during the vocabulary load process. The metadata index allows for the metadata of multiple code systems to be cross-indexed and searched as part of the query subsystem.Finally, the LexBIG architecture provides the underpinnings for LexBIG services to be made accessible through the caGRID environment in the future, where vocabulary services might be deployed and discovered within a caGRID Globus container. However, this portion of the API is preliminary and awaits coordination with caBIG® Architecture WS designees to determine exact recommendations and nature of LexBIG services on the grid.

<h4 id="LexBIG1.0.2Developer&#39;sTechnicalGuide-Overview.7">
  Overview
</h4>
This subsystem provides the functionality required to fulfill caCORE/EVS and other vocabulary requests. The Query Service is comprised of Lexical Operations, Graph Operations, Metadata, and History Operations.
<ul>
  <li>
    Lexical Set Operations - Lexical Set Operations provides methods to return a lists or iterators of coded entries. Supported query criteria include the application of match/filter algorithms, sorting algorithms, and property restrictions. Support is also provided to resolve the union, intersection or difference of two node sets.
  </li>
  <li>
    Graph Set Operations - Graph Operations support the subsetting of concepts according to relationship and distance, identification of relation source and target concepts, and graph traversal. Additional operations include enumeration and traversal of concepts by relation, walking of directed acyclic graphs (DAGs), enumeration of source and target concepts for a relation, and enumeration of relations for a concept.
  </li>
  <li>
    Metadata Operations - Metadata Operations allows for the query and resolution of registered code system metadata according to specified coding scheme references, property names, or values.
  </li>
  <li>
    History Operations - History provides vocabulary-specific information about concept insertions, modifications, splits, merges, and retirements when supplied by the content provider.

  Information Models
</a>
describes the general format and organization of information handled by the LexBIG runtime. This section describes the primary application programming interfaces used to take action (e.g. retrieve or administer) against that content.NoteThe information below is provided for introductory purposes. A full description of all available classes and methods is also available in the javadoc distributed with the LexBIG installation package (see file breakdown in

  Overview
</h3>
Programming interfaces for the system fall into three primary categories:
<ul>
  <li>
    Core Services - Includes the LexBIGService, LexBIGServiceManager, CodedNodeSet and CodedNodeGraph classes, which provide the initial entry points for programmatic access to all system features and data.
  </li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>
    Service Extensions - The extension mechanism provides for pluggable system features. Current extension points allow for the introduction of custom load and indexing mechanisms, unique query sort and filter mechanisms, and generic functional extensions which can be advertised for availability to client programs.
  </li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>
    Utilities - Utility classes, such as those implementing iterator support, are provided by the system to provide convenience and optimize the handling of resources accessed through the runtime.

  Examples and Recommendations for Use
</h3>
<h4 id="LexBIG1.0.2Developer&#39;sTechnicalGuide-ConceptResolution.1">
  Concept Resolution
</h4>
Programmers access coded concepts by acquiring first a node set or graph. After specifying optional restrictions, the nodes in this set or graph can be resolved as a list of ConceptReference objects which in turn contain references to one or more Concept objects. The following example provides a simple query of concept codes:
<img alt="image showing a code snippet for a simple query of concept codes" src="https://wiki.nci.nih.gov/download/attachments/embedded-page/LexEVS/LexBIG%201.0.2%20Developer&#39;s%20Technical%20Guide/Query_of_Concept_Codes.jpg?api=v2">
<h4 id="LexBIG1.0.2Developer&#39;sTechnicalGuide-ServiceMetadataRetrieval">
  Service Metadata Retrieval
</h4>
The LexBIG system maintains service metadata which can provide client programs with information about code system content and assigned copyright/licensing information. Below is an brief example showing how to access and print some of this metadata:
<img alt="image showing a code snippet for accessing and printing service metadata" src="https://wiki.nci.nih.gov/download/attachments/embedded-page/LexEVS/LexBIG%201.0.2%20Developer&#39;s%20Technical%20Guide/Service_Metadata.jpg?api=v2">
<h4 id="LexBIG1.0.2Developer&#39;sTechnicalGuide-CombinatorialQueries">
  Combinatorial Queries
</h4>
One of the most powerful features of the LexBIG architecture is the ability to define multiple search and sort criteria without intermediate retrieval of data from the LexBIG service. Consider the following code snippet:
<img alt="image showing a code snippet for a query that will search a code system based on a &#39;sounds like&#39; match algorithm" src="https://wiki.nci.nih.gov/download/attachments/embedded-page/LexEVS/LexBIG%201.0.2%20Developer&#39;s%20Technical%20Guide/Combinatorial_Queries.jpg?api=v2">
This example shows a simple yet powerful query to search a code system based on a &#39;sounds like&#39; match algorithm (the list of all available match algorithms can be listed using the &#39;ListExtensions -m&#39; admin script).Declaring the target concept spaceThe coded node set (variable &#39;cns&#39;) is initially declared to query the NCI Thesaurus vocabulary. At this point the concept space included by the set can be thought of as unrestricted, addressing every defined coded entry (the &#39;false&#39; value on the declaration indicates to also include inactive concepts). However, it important to note that no search is performed by the LexBIG service at this time.Applying filter criteriaSimilarly, no computation is performed (to realize query results) during invocation of the &lt;tt&gt;restrictToMatchingDesignations()&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;restrictToMatchingProperties()&lt;/tt&gt; methods. However, these calls effectively narrow the target space even further, indicating that filters should be applied to the information returned by the LexBIG query service.Using the Lucene Query Syntax and other text matching functionsThe text criteria applied in methods such as restrictToMatchingDesignations() uses one of a number of powerful text processing applications to provide the user with broad capability for text based searches. Text matches can be simple applications of exactMatch, startsWith or contains algorithms as well as powerful regular expressions and Lucene Query syntax (used in the LuceneQuery function.) As shown above these options are passed into the restrictToMatchingDesignations() Method as parameters.Lucene Queries are well documented and can be very powerful. The uninitiated user may need some background on their use however. The user should start here with the official Lucene Query Parser documentation.Keep in mind that some LexBIG queries such as &#34;startsWith&#34; and &#34;contains&#34; use wild card searches under the covers, so that use of wild cards in this context can cause errors in searches involving these search types.Instead it is best to use the flexibility of the Lucene Query searches in the matchingDesignation by using the Lucene Query searches in LexBIG where most searches will work much as described in the query syntax documentation.Special characters in the Lucene Query search can cause unexpected results. If you are not using special characters as recommended for various Lucene search mechanisms then your searches may not return expected results or may return an error. If the value you are searching upon contains say, parenthesis, you will need to place the value in quotations. The escape characters described in the Lucene Documentation do not work at this time.Likewise you should not expect to see a Lucene Query narrow down search results as you progressively enter a longer substring more closely matching your term of interest. Instead use the contains method.Applying sorting criteriaMultiple sort algorithms can be applied to control the order of items returned. In this case, we indicate that results are to be sorted based on primary and secondary criteria. The &#34;matchToQuery&#34; algorithm indicates to sort the result according to best match as determined by the search engine. The &#34;code&#34; item indicates to perform a secondary sort based on concept code.NoteThe list of all available sort algorithms can be listed using the &#39;ListExtensions -s&#39; admin script.Restricting the information returned for matching itemsThe LexBIG API also allows the programmer to restrict the values returned for each matching concept. In this example, we chose to return only the UMLS CUI and assigned text presentations.Retrieving the resultA query is finally performed during the &#39;resolve&#39; step, with results returned to the declared list. It is at this point that the LexBIG service does the heavy lifting. By declaring the full extent of the request up front (namespace, match criteria, sort criteria, and returned values), the service then has the opportunity to optimize the query path. In addition, in this example we restrict the number of items returned to a maximum of 6. This combined approach has the benefit of reducing server-side processing while minimizing the volume and frequency of traffic between the client program and the LexBIG service.NoteWhile this section provides one example of combining criteria, this same pattern can be applied to many of the &lt;tt&gt;CodedNodeSet&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;CodedNodeGraph&lt;/tt&gt; operations. It is strongly recommended that programmers familiarize themselves with this programming model and its application.

<h4 id="LexBIG1.0.2Developer&#39;sTechnicalGuide-Overview.9">
  Overview
</h4>
The upper section of the GUI shows all of the code systems currently loaded, along with corresponding metadata. The lower section of the GUI is used to combine, restrict and resolve Code Sets and Code Graphs.The lower left section is where you can perform Boolean logic on Code Sets and Code Graphs. The lower right section is where you can introduce restrictions on Code Sets and Code Graphs and browse results.NoteThe menu options are used primarily for administrative functions, and are covered in detail by the LexBIG Administrator&#39;s Guide. In addition, all of the disabled buttons in the top half of the application are used for administrative functions, and are also described in the LexBIG Administrator&#39;s Guide.
<h4 id="LexBIG1.0.2Developer&#39;sTechnicalGuide-CreatingNewQueries">
  Creating New Queries
</h4>
There are four buttons on the top half that are of interest for creating queries.
<ul>
  <li>
    Refresh - This button causes the LexBIG GUI to reread the available terminologies and their respective metadata. This can be useful when using the GUI to view a LexBIG environment that is being modified by another process.
  </li>
  <li>
    Get History - If a terminology with available history data is selected, this button opens a history browser to view it via the NCI history API. This option is currently only applicable when working with the NCI Thesaurus terminology.
  </li>
  <li>
    Get Code Set - This button causes the selected terminology to be added to the lower left section of the GUI as a code set - which is noted by a &#39;CS&#39; prefix.
  </li>
  <li>
    Get Code Graph - This button causes the selected terminology to be added to the lower left section of the GUI as a code graph - which is noted by a &#39;CG&#39; prefix.
  </li>
</ul>
<h4 id="LexBIG1.0.2Developer&#39;sTechnicalGuide-CustomizingQueries">
  Customizing Queries
</h4>
After selecting a code system and clicking on Get Code Set or Get Code Graph, a row will be added to the lower left section of the GUI for each click. There are seven buttons in the lower left section that allow combinatorial logic between the code sets in the lower left.
<ul>
  <li>
    Union - This button is enabled if two Code Sets or two Code Graphs are selected in the lower left. Clicking the button creates a new virtual Code Set or Code Graph which represents the Boolean union of the two selected items. All restrictions applied to the individual items still apply.
  </li>
  <li>
    Intersection - This button is enabled if two Code Sets or two Code Graphs are selected in the lower left. Clicking the button creates a new virtual Code Set or Code Graph which represents the Boolean intersection of the two selected items. All restrictions applied to the individual items still apply.
  </li>
  <li>
    Difference - This button is enabled if two Code Sets or two Code Graphs are selected in the lower left. Clicking the button creates a new virtual Code Set which represents the Boolean difference of the two selected Code Sets. All restrictions applied to the individual items still apply.
  </li>
  <li>
    Restrict to Codes - This button is enabled if a Code Set and a Code Graph are selected in the lower left. Clicking the button creates a new virtual Code Graph which will be restricted to concept codes occurring in the selected Code Set.
  </li>
  <li>
    Restrict to Source Codes - This button is enabled if a Code Set and a Code Graph are selected in the lower left. Clicking the button creates a new virtual Code Graph which will have its source codes restricted to codes occurring in the selected Code Set.
  </li>
  <li>
    Restrict to Target Codes - This button is enabled if a Code Set and a Code Graph are selected in the lower left. Clicking the button creates a new virtual Code Graph which will have its target codes restricted to codes occurring in the selected Code Set.
  </li>
  <li>
    Remove - This button is enabled if any Code Set or Code Graph (or virtual Code Set or Code Graph) is selected in the lower left. Clicking the button will remove the selected item from the list.
  </li>
</ul>
The lower right section of the GUI is used to apply restrictions to Code Sets or Code Graphs, and set the variables that need to be passed into the resolve method.
<h4 id="LexBIG1.0.2Developer&#39;sTechnicalGuide-WorkingwithCodeSets">
  Working with Code Sets
</h4>
If a Code Set is selected in the lower left, then the lower right section will look like this:

In the lower right section, there are two halves - the top half and the bottom half. The top half is used to apply restrictions. The bottom half provides query options and resolution.
<ul>
  <li>
    Add - This button introduces a new restriction to the Coded Node Set. Clicking it will bring up the following dialog box for creating restrictions:
    <img alt="screenshot of an example Coded Restriction dialog box in which you can select the type of restriction" src="https://wiki.nci.nih.gov/download/attachments/embedded-page/LexEVS/LexBIG%201.0.2%20Developer&#39;s%20Technical%20Guide/Configure_Restriction_Window.jpg?api=v2">
    The top drop down list indicates the type of restriction to add. The rest of the dialog box will change depending on the type of restriction selected. All required parameters for the selected restriction type will be presented.
  </li>
  <li>
    Edit - This button is enabled when a restriction is selected. Clicking it allows revision of an existing restriction.
  </li>
  <li>
    Remove -This button is enabled when a restriction is selected. Clicking it removes the selected restriction.
  </li>
  <li>

The left side shows a list of all the concept codes returned. When a concept code is selected on the left, the upper right will show a full description of the selected code. The lower right will show a graph view of the neighboring concepts.When a Coded Node Graph is resolved, the result viewing window will look like this (this is the same Code System as above):
<img alt="Result Viewing window example described in the following content" src="https://wiki.nci.nih.gov/download/attachments/embedded-page/LexEVS/LexBIG%201.0.2%20Developer&#39;s%20Technical%20Guide/Result_Browser_Resolved_Coded_Node_Graph.jpg?api=v2">
The left side still has a list of all of the concepts in the graph. The upper right will give a description of the selected concept. The lower right shows the entire graph.The lower right section is adjustable, and dynamic. It responds to mouse clicks, dragging, and numerous key combinations. Beyond a depth of 3, the graph may &#34;collapse&#34; and not show all of the nodes until you click on a node. Clicking on a node will cause it to expand out and display its children. Here are a list of key combinations recognized by the graph viewer:
<ul>
  <li>
    Left Click + Mouse Movement - Drags the view.
  </li>
  <li>
    Right Click + Mouse Movement Up Or Down - Zooms in or out.
  </li>
  <li>
    Right Click (on white space) - Zooms the view to fit.
  </li>
  <li>
    Ctrl + &#39;+&#39; - Expands the graph connection lines
  </li>
  <li>
    Ctrl + &#39;-&#39; - Contracts the graph connection lines
  </li>
  <li>
    Ctrl + &#39;1&#39; (or &#39;2&#39; or &#39;3&#39; or &#39;4&#39;) - Changes the orientation of the graph.
