  Enhancement
</h2>
Consider conceptual normalization of data structures regardless of loader used (e.g. GO in OBO and GO loaded via Owl should look the same if they are the same content)
<ul>
  <li>
    Per the CTS2 specification loaded format is part of the identity of a code system; therefore different formats of the same thing are not necessarily interchangeable. This could potentially take a huge harmonization effort to make these look the same.
  </li>
</ul>

</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    All loaders would have to change.
  </li>
  <li>
    Would need harmonization documentation/agreement
  </li>
</ul>
