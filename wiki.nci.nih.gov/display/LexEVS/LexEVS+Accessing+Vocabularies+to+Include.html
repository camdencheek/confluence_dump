      BiomedGT
    </a>
    The Biomedical Grid Terminology (BiomedGT) is an open, collaboratively developed terminology for translational research. BiomedGT builds on the strengths of the NCI Thesaurus, including concept orientation, description logic, and public accessibility. While the current terminology has been seeded with NCI Thesaurus content, it is being restructured to facilitate open content development. The goal is to evolve BiomedGT into a set of federated sub-terminologies, with content maintained by experts in the relevant research communities.

      Ontology Lookup Service
    </a>
    The Ontology Lookup Service is a spin-off of the PRIDE project, which required a centralized query interface for ontology and controlled vocabulary lookup. The OLS provides a web service interface to query multiple ontologies from a single location with a unified output format.  The OLS can integrate any ontology available in the Open Biomedical Ontology (OBO) format.
