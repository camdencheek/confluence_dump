            LexEVS, CTS2, URI Resolver use the v1x.  It doesn&#39;t have the current urgent issue but is not being maintained

                CTS2 base framework needs to be updated, but does not look too complicated.

                URI Resolver looks like possibly just a pom file change

            There is an elastic search on Stage but we think it has to do with evsrestapi V2. It can probably be shut down.
          </li>

            AWS - using ElasticSearch but might be supported by them??  6.8.22?
