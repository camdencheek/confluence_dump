  Enhancement
</h2>
Clean up of all admin scripts - functionality should match documentationQuestion: Any examples? 1. CleanUpLuceneIndex - this script has no internal documentation and I&#39;m not sure what it&#39;s function is. Is this only useful if we don&#39;t have a common index? 2. ExportDDLScripts - No internal documentation, don&#39;t know what this does. 3. ListExtensions - Documentation talks about codingSchemes and activation, unrelated to what is actually does. 4. LoadManifest - All the quotes in this script are escaped, which makes it hard to read. None of the other scripts do this. 5. LoadMetadata - Unclear of the difference between -o and -f, and whether both work. 6. PasswordEncryptor - Encrypts a password and does what with it? 7. RebuildIndex and RemoveIndex - both refer to the index name. Is this only for installs without a common index? How is this used? 8. ResumeMetaBatch - asks for a source vocabulary, which doesn&#39;t apply to Meta. 9. TransferScheme - says it exports to OBO. How is this different than ExportOBO?
