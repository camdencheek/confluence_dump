The LexBIG install provides a config.props file to configure options for the LexBIG service and database settings. The LexBIG Service can be configured to work with many different databases, but the recommended databases are MySQL 4.1.16 (or higher) or PostgreSQL 8.x. Following installation, the Administrator should examine the config.props file and make any changes required to match the target database and runtime environment.

<ul>
  <li>
    The file {LEXBIG_DIRECTORY}/resources/config/config.props contains properties controlling the behavior of the LexBIG runtime.

AttentionIt is considered beyond the scope of this manual to address database (e.g. MySQL or PostgreSQL) setup and administration. However, proper database configuration is critical to the performance and long-term health of the LexBIG environment. System administrators should consult the MySQL or PostgreSQL documentation to determine settings that are appropriate to the host machine and environment. Tuning should be performed prior to loading vocabularies.

NoteMySQL can be passed a jdbc option for the Windows local environment that may improve performance 30 to 50%.Try the following values in the config.props file for the DB_URL:
SINGLE_DB_MODE=true
DB_URL=jdbc:mysql:///&lt;dbname&gt;?socketFactory=com.mysql.jdbc.NamedPipeSocketFactory
DB_DRIVER=org.gjt.mm.mysql.Driver
DB_USER=root
DB_PASSWORD=
DB_PREFIX=lb

This uses Windows Named Pipe function and avoids use of the TCP/IP protocol. It only works when connecting with a local iteration of the MySQL database on Windows.

  Tips and Pitfalls
</h3>
<h4 id="LexBIG1.0.2InstallationandAdministrationGuide-UpgradingLexBIG">
  Upgrading LexBIG
</h4>
Upgrading LexBIG may require reloading content. Be sure to read the release notes for each LexBIG release before installing the latest version. Preserve configuration files and indexes unless instructed to reload or do otherwise in the release notes. These files include config.props, registry.xml and the entire lbIndex directory in the resources directory. |
<h4 id="LexBIG1.0.2InstallationandAdministrationGuide-SingleandMultipleDatabaseConfigurationChanges">
  Single and Multiple Database Configuration Changes
</h4>
Do not attempt to change database configurations from single database mode to multi-database mode and vice versa after loading in one mode or the other. LexBIG does not support both configurations at once.
<h4 id="LexBIG1.0.2InstallationandAdministrationGuide-FailedandInterruptedLoads">
  Failed and Interrupted Loads
</h4>
LexBIG loads of content are generally handled in a robust manner and failed loads clean up after themselves relatively well when dbms&#39; are properly configured to allow database drop functions by LexBIG. However, exiting the application in the middle of a load may cause unpredictable consequences with databases, indexes and lock files left in a state that will cause subsequent loads of the same terminology to fail.
<ul>
  <li>
    Often these can be remedied by deleting the lock.xml file followed by using the cleanup function.
  </li>
  <li>
    Other steps may need to be taken if this doesn&#39;t work, including dropping databases as a dba, deleting the index file for the offending terminology, and editing the registry.xml and metadata.xml files by hand.
  </li>
  <li>
    A quick, dirty solution is to drop all databases and delete all configuration files except config.props.
  </li>
</ul>
<h4 id="LexBIG1.0.2InstallationandAdministrationGuide-WhentoScaleaDbmsforaLargeNumberofConnections">
  When to Scale a Dbms for a Large Number of Connections
</h4>
LexBIG is configured for multi-database loads and has multiple users connecting to all terminologies, then the administrator will need to scale database configurations to adapt to this. If you have large number of terminologies loaded and a large user base connecting to the service using the lbGUI, then you will need the database configuration for number of connections scaled appropriately or users may not be able to connect.NoteLoading in single database mode can eliminate this problem.
<h4 id="LexBIG1.0.2InstallationandAdministrationGuide-MySQLDriverIssues">
  MySQL Driver Issues
</h4>
LexBIG is distributed with an older version of the Java MySQL driver due to licensing concerns. If LexBIG reports an error concerning establishing a connection to the MySQL server yet the MySQL CLI is able to connect, a new version of Connector/J may be required.The latest version of Connector/J is available from MySQL.org. The new jar should be placed in the LexGrid/LexBIG/2.0.0/runtime/sqlDrivers/ directory. Remove the existing mm.mysql-2.0.6.jar to ensure that the class loader does not incorrectly load the older driver file. |

  Installing LexBIG into JBoss
</h2>
<h3 id="LexBIG1.0.2InstallationandAdministrationGuide-Introduction.1">
  Introduction
</h3>
Since LexBIG is server oriented software, a common deployment scenario is to package LexBIG into a WAR file and deploy it into JBoss or another Application Server. The following are recommendations for packaging and configuring LexBIG for JBoss usage.If not deploying into an Application Server such as JBoss, this chapter can be skipped. While these instructions are tailored to JBoss, they should serve as a reasonable guide in packaging for other Application Servers.Complete a standalone installation of LexBIG before starting this section. These files will be copied to create your JBoss package.
<h3 id="LexBIG1.0.2InstallationandAdministrationGuide-CreatingyourWARfile">
  Creating your WAR file
</h3>
To add LexBIG functionality to a WAR file, add the lexbig.jar file to the lib folder of the WAR file. Adding the lbRuntime.jar file to the lib folder may result in the duplication of many common libraries that LexBIG and JBoss share. In particular errors will occur due to a collision between the log4j libraries that LexBIG and JBoss both use.The lexbig.jar can be found in the &#39;runtime-components&#39; folder of the LexBIG installation.The lexbig.jar file adds LexBIG runtime functionality to JBoss; however, 3rd party dependencies must be added to the WAR file lib folder as well. These jar files are located in the &#39;runtime-components/extLib&#39; subfolder as shown in the figure below.
<img alt="screenshot of an explorer screen showing the location of the extLib subfolder" src="https://wiki.nci.nih.gov/download/attachments/embedded-page/LexEVS/LexBIG%201.0.2%20Installation%20and%20Administration%20Guide/Jar_Files_Location.jpg?api=v2">
Avoid duplicating jars already contained in the WAR package or jar files that JBoss already provides. For example, JBoss already provides a log4j x.x.x.jar&#39; - this file should NOT BE COPIED into the WAR package. This jar is singled out because it is known to cause errors in JBoss if you deploy a WAR file that contains a log4j library.Do not copy files from &#39;runtime-components/extLib/guiLibraries&#39; or any of the sql drivers in the &#39;sqlDrivers&#39; folder. The gui libraries are not needed and the sql drivers will be dealt with later.
<h3 id="LexBIG1.0.2InstallationandAdministrationGuide-CreatingtheFileStorageLocationfortheLexBIGRuntime">
  Creating the File Storage Location for the LexBIG Runtime
</h3>
LexBIG runtime needs to have the ability to read and write from a local file system in order to function properly. The files that it writes also need to persist through a stop and start of the JBoss server. These files cannot be placed inside of the WAR file, since JBoss extracts WAR files into a differently named temporary folder every time it starts up.
<ol>
  <li>
    Create a single folder to store this information, and configure the LexBIG JBoss instance to use this folder while it is running for all of its file system access needs.
  </li>
  <li>
    Create a top level folder named &#39;LexBIGData&#39;. Create sub-folders in this directory named &#39;config&#39;, &#39;lbIndex&#39;, &#39;libs&#39;, and &#39;logs&#39;. Below is a screenshot of this file structure:
    <img alt="screenshot showing the file structure as described in the previous content" src="https://wiki.nci.nih.gov/download/attachments/embedded-page/LexEVS/LexBIG%201.0.2%20Installation%20and%20Administration%20Guide/File_Structure_Screenshot.jpg?api=v2">
  </li>
  <li>
    The folder &#39;config&#39; is used for storing the LexBIG configuration, storing the terminology registry, and storing lock files. Copy &#39;LexBIG &lt;version&gt;\resources\config\config.props&#39; into this folder now. This file will be customized later.
  </li>
  <li>
    The folder &#39;lbIndex&#39; is where LexBIG will store the indexes that it creates. Leave this folder empty.
  </li>
  <li>
    In the folder &#39;libs&#39; copy the SQL drivers. Keep in mind that the SQL driver that ships with LexBIG is not compatable with the latetest MySQL versions. Licensing restrictions prevent shipping the latest drivers and they must be downloaded by the user. Any LexBIG extensions can also be placed here. Copy the jar &#39;LexBIG 1.0.1\runtime-components\lexbig.jar&#39; into this folder. A duplicate of this jar file needs to be here to assist with some custom classloader work that bypasses the normal classpaths.
  </li>
  <li>
    The folder &#39;logs&#39; is where LexBIG will write its log messages. Leave this folder empty.
  </li>
</ol>
Your directory structure should now look like the screen shot above.
<h3 id="LexBIG1.0.2InstallationandAdministrationGuide-Configuringconfig.propsforJBossDeployment">
  Configuring config.props for JBoss Deployment
</h3>
There are a few variables in the config.props file in your LexBIGData folder that will need to be changed for the JBoss deployment. There are a number of ways that this file can be configured - but these instructions set up directories relative paths - allowing the WAR file to be easily moved from one server to another.The config.props file should already be configured for standalone mode at this point, as described earlier in the manual. This section will only describe the changes that should be made for JBoss deployment.There following five variables need to be set to the following values in the config.props file.

        This variable is being left blank. This will cause LexBIG to automatically set this variable to the location of the config.props file when it starts up. All other paths in the config.props file can then be set relative to the folder that contains the config.props file that was found when the system started up - and it should use the config.props file in your LexBIGData folder.

  Locating the File Storage Location for the LexBIG Runtime
</h3>
Now that you have created your LexBIGData folder, and configured the config.props file, you need to decide where to place it on the system where JBoss and your WAR file will be deployed. Location is up to the user - so long as it is permanent. A couple of possibilities include keeping it with JBoss – in the JBoss data folder, \...\jboss-4.0.4.GA\server\default\data\LexBIGData, or it could go into a typical Linux application folder such as /apps/LexBIG/LexBIGData/.
<h3 id="LexBIG1.0.2InstallationandAdministrationGuide-Locatingtheconfig.propsFilewhenJBossStarts">
  Locating the config.props File when JBoss Starts
</h3>
The only step remaining now is to help LexBIG find the proper config.props file when it initializes. There are a number of ways that this could be done - but the easiest way is to set the Java System Variable LG_CONFIG_FILE to the location of the config.props file.This can be done by modifying the script that launches JBoss - adding the following (modify as appropriate for the place that you picked for your LexBIGData folder)-DLG_CONFIG_FILE=C:\Program Files\jboss-4.0.4.GA\server\default\data\LexBIGData\config\config.propsAlternatively, you could programmatically set this system variable from your application when it starts up and before it makes its first LexBIG call.Read the documentation in the config.props file for other LG_CONFIG_FILE configuration possibilities.NoteJBoss tends to run out of memory while running with the default settings of JBoss. To fix the problem, modify the run.conf file under JBOSS_home/bin to change the memory setting and how frequently the rmi garbage collector runs, by editing the JAVA_OPTS line as follows:
if [ &#34;x$JAVA_OPTS&#34; = &#34;x&#34; ]; then
JAVA_OPTS=&#34;-server -XX:MaxPermSize=128m -Xms256m -Xmx2000m -Dsun.rmi.dgc.client.gcInterval=120000 -Dsun.rmi.dgc.server.gcInterval=120000&#34;

<h2 id="LexBIG1.0.2InstallationandAdministrationGuide-MovingaTerminologytoanotherSQLServer">
  Moving a Terminology to another SQL Server
</h2>
In some deployment scenarios, it may be necessary to move a very large terminology onto a different SQL server than the standard LexBIG server configured above for scalability reasons.This is supported, but there are some limitations and cautions as described in the bullets that follow:
<ul>
  <li>
    Manually edit the registry.xml file (It may have an alternate name as denoted in the REGISTRY_FILE variable of config.props) with a text editor.
  </li>
  <li>
    This terminology cannot be removed using the LexBIG API. To remove the terminology, edit the registry.xml file again, and manually drop the database from the server. This leaves an orphaned index – running the orphaned resources clean up tool wipes the index and associated entries.
  </li>
  <li>
    This &#34;extra&#34; SQL server must use the same driver and same username and password as the default LexBIG server since the configuration file only supports a single password and username set.
  </li>
</ul>
Steps to move a terminology to a new server:
<ol>
  <li>
    Manually move the proper database (or proper subset of tables in SINGLE_DB_MODE) to the new server. The LexBIG TransferScheme tool (in the admin scripts folder) can help you determine the proper SQL databases, tables, and commands that you will need to use to accomplish this. Alternatively, you can look at the registry.xml file to determine what database and/or tables you need to move.
  </li>
  <li>
    Manually edit the registry.xml file. You will need to change the value of the dbURL parameter on the proper line for this terminology that you are using.
  </li>
  <li>
    Restart LexBIG, and ensure that the terminology is still available.
  </li>
</ol>

            NoteUMLS Metathesaurus RRF files are a very large fileset. Many users prefer to subset these files using the Metamorphosys tool included with the UMLS Metathesaurus in order to move a single terminology from a central location of these files. When generating source RRF files from the Metathesaurus, the Metamorphosys tool should be set to output versionless source abbreviations rather than versioned source abbreviations. Failing to do so before loading RRF files to LexBIG will cause an incomplete database to be created leaving the association and concept tables empty.

  Loading a Sample Vocabulary
</h3>
This LexBIG installation provides the UMLS Semantic Net and a sampling of the NCI Thesaurus content (sample.owl) that can be loaded into the database.
<ol>
  <li>
    In a Command Promptwindow, enter the following command to go to the example programs.
    cd {LEXBIG_DIRECTORY}/examples
  </li>
  <li>
    To load the example vocabularies, run the appropriate LoadSampleData script (LoadSampleData.bat for Windows; LoadSampleData.sh for Linux).NoteVocabularies should not be loaded until configuration of the LexBIG runtime and database server are complete.
    <img alt="screenshot that shows the successful load of the sample vocabulary file in a Windows command screen" src="https://wiki.nci.nih.gov/download/attachments/embedded-page/LexEVS/LexBIG%201.0.2%20Installation%20and%20Administration%20Guide/Successful_Load_of_Sample_Vocabulary.jpg?api=v2">

  Installing NCI Thesaurus Vocabulary
</h3>
This section describes the steps to download and install a full version of the NCI Thesaurus for the LexBIG Service.
<ol>
  <li>
    Using a web or ftp client go to URL: ftp://ftp1.nci.nih.gov/pub/cacore/EVS/
    <img alt="screenshot showing the files in the EVS directory" src="https://wiki.nci.nih.gov/download/attachments/embedded-page/LexEVS/LexBIG%201.0.2%20Installation%20and%20Administration%20Guide/Ftp_Directory.jpg?api=v2">
  </li>
  <li>
    Select the version of NCI Thesaurus OWL you wish to download and save the file to a directory on your machine.
  </li>
  <li>
    Extract the OWL file from the zip download and save in a directory on your machine. This directory will be referred to as NCI_THESAURUS_DIRECTORY
  </li>
  <li>
    Using the LexBIG utilities load the NCI Thesaurus:
    cd {LexBIG_DIRECTORY}/admin
    <ul>
      <li>
        For Windows installation use the following command
        LoadNCIThesOWL.bat -nf -in &#34;file:///{NCI_THESAURUS_DIRECTORY}/Thesaurus_05.12f.owl&#34;
      </li>
      <li>
        For Linux installation use the following command
        LoadNCIThesOWL.sh -nf -in &#34;file:///{NCI_THESAURUS_DIRECTORY}/Thesaurus_05.12f.owl&#34;
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>
NoteThis step will require about three hours on a Pentium 3.0 Ghz machine. The total time to load NCI Thesaurus will vary depending on machine, memory, and disk speed.The following example shows output from load of NCI Thesaurus 05.12f.

  Installing NCI Metathesaurus Vocabulary
</h3>
This section describes the steps to download and install a full version of the NCI Metathesaurus for the LexBIG Service.
<ol>
  <li>
    Using a web or ftp client go to URL: ftp://ftp1.nci.nih.gov/pub/cacore/EVS/
    <img alt="screenshot showing the contents of the EVS directory" src="https://wiki.nci.nih.gov/download/attachments/embedded-page/LexEVS/LexBIG%201.0.2%20Installation%20and%20Administration%20Guide/Ftp_Client.jpg?api=v2">
  </li>
  <li>
    Select the version of NCI Metathesaurus RRF you wish to download and save the file to a directory on your machine.
  </li>
  <li>
    Extract the RRF files from the zip download and save in a directory on your machine. This directory will be referred to as NCI_METATHESAURUS_DIRECTORY.NoteRELASE_INFO.RRF is required to be present for the load utility to work.
  </li>
  <li>
    Using the LexBIG utilities load the NCI Thesaurus
    cd {LexBIG_DIRECTORY}/admin
    <ul>
      <li>
        For Windows installation use the following command
        LoadNCIMeta.bat -nf -in &#34;file:///{NCI_METATHESAURUS_DIRECTORY}/&#34;
      </li>
      <li>
        For Linux installation use the following command
        LoadNCIMeta.sh -nf -in &#34;file:///{NCI_THESAURUS_DIRECTORY}/&#34;
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>
NoteNCI Metathesaurus contains many individual vocabularies and requires several hours to load and index. This step requires about 15 hours on a Pentium 3.0 Ghz machine with 7200rpm disk. The total time to load NCI MetaThesaurus will vary depending on machine, memory, and disk speed.

  Installing NCI History Information
</h3>
This section describes the steps to download and install a history file for NCI Thesaurus.
<ol>
  <li>
    Using a web or ftp client go to URL: ftp://ftp1.nci.nih.gov/pub/cacore/EVS/  &lt;TO BE DETERMINED&gt;
  </li>
  <li>
    Select the version of NCI History you wish to download. Save the file to a directory on your machine. Select the VersionFile download to the same directory as the history file.
  </li>
  <li>
    Extract the History files from the zip download and save in a directory on your machine. This directory will be referred to as NCI_HISTORY_DIRECTORY
  </li>
  <li>
    Using the LexBIG utilities load the NCI Thesaurus
    cd {LexBIG_DIRECTORY}/admin
    <ul>
      <li>
        For Windows installation use the following command
        LoadNCIHistory.bat -nf -in &#34;file:///{NCI_HISTORY_DIRECTORY}&#34; -vf &#34;file:///NCI_HISTORY_DIRECTORY}/VersionFile&#34;
      </li>
      <li>
        For Linux installation use the following command
        LoadNCIHistory.sh -nf -in &#34;file:///{NCI_HISTORY_DIRECTORY}&#34; -vf &#34;file:///NCI_HISTORY_DIRECTORY}/VersionFile&#34;
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>
NoteIf a &#39;releaseId&#39; occurs twice in the file, the last occurrence will be stored. If LexBIG already knows about a releaseId (from a previous history load), the information is updated to match what is provided in the file. This file has to be provided to the load API on every load because you will need to maintain it in the future as each new release is made. We have created this file that should be valid as of today from the information that we found in the archive folder on your ftp server. You can find this file in the &#39;resources&#39; directory of the LexBIG install.

  Deactivating and Removing Vocabulary
</h3>
This section describes the steps to deactivate a coding scheme and remove coding scheme from LexBIG Service.
<ol>
  <li>
    Change directory to LexBIG administration directory. Enter:
    cd {LEXBIG_DIRECTORY}/admin
  </li>
  <li>
    Use the DeactiveScheme utility to prevent access to coding scheme. Once a coding scheme is deactivated, client programs will not be able to access the content for the specific coding scheme and version. Example:
    DeactivateScheme -u &#34;urn:oid:2.16.840.1.113883.3.26.1.1&#34; -v &#34;05.12f&#34;
  </li>
  <li>
    Use RemoveScheme utility to remove coding scheme from LexBIG service and database. Example:
    RemoveScheme -u &#34;urn:oid:2.16.840.1.113883.3.26.1.1&#34; -v &#34;05.12f&#34;
  </li>

<h3 id="LexBIG1.0.2InstallationandAdministrationGuide-Taggingavocabulary">
  Tagging a vocabulary
</h3>
This section describes the steps to tag a coding scheme to be used via LexBIG API.
<ol>
  <li>
    Change directory to LexBIG administration directory. Enter:
    cd {LEXBIG_DIRECTORY}/admin
  </li>
  <li>
    Use the TagScheme to tag a coding system and version with a local tag name (e.g. PRODUCTION). This tag name can be used via LexBIG API for query restriction. Example:
    TagScheme -u &#34;urn:oid:2.16.840.1.113883.3.26.1.1&#34; -v &#34;05.12f&#34;  -t &#34;PRODUCTION&#34;

  System Monitoring and Debug
</h3>
This section describes the configuration and use of LexBIG logs for system monitoring and debugging. The LexBIG service uses a set of log files. The log files are stored based on the LexBIG config.props file settings. Refer to Modifying the config.props file for LexBIG on page 23 for additional detail configuration parameters.To view the LexBIG service and load log files perform the following steps.
<ol>
  <li>
    Change directory to LexBIG administration directory based on the settings of the config.props log_file_location setting.
  </li>
  <li>
    Open the file LexBIG_full_log.txt using text editor to review details about LexBIG service.

<h4 id="LexBIG1.0.2InstallationandAdministrationGuide-WhatIsCodingSchemeManifest?">
  What Is Coding Scheme Manifest?
</h4>
A &#34;Coding Scheme Manifest&#34; (or simply &#34;manifest&#34; as used interchangeably in this document) allows the user to set values for a coding scheme while loading or converting a LexGrid &#34;XML&#34;, &#34;NCI MetaThesaurus&#34;, &#34;NCI OWL&#34;,&#34;OWL&#34;, &#34;OBO&#34;, &#34;UMLS RRF File&#34;, or&#34;HL7 RIM Database&#34; source to LexGrid format.
<h4 id="LexBIG1.0.2InstallationandAdministrationGuide-WhatIsCodingScheme?">
  What Is Coding Scheme?
</h4>
Coding Scheme is the term that is used to represent an ontology/terminology being loaded or converted. In the LexGrid data model a terminology is represented as a coding scheme and it can reference other coding schemes. An example of coding scheme is &#34;Amino Acid&#34; which is described in the &#34;amino acid.owl&#34; file.A Coding Scheme has some meta information about it; values like &#39;formal name&#39;, &#39;local names&#39;, &#39;default language&#39;, &#39;version&#39;, &#39;copyright&#39;, &#39;sources&#39; to name some.
<h4 id="LexBIG1.0.2InstallationandAdministrationGuide-WhyDoWeNeedaCodingSchemeManifest?">
  Why Do We Need a Coding Scheme Manifest?
</h4>
When a terminology is being converted to the LexGrid data model from its native format (in this case OWL), Coding Scheme information is read from the source file. Sometimes values may be missing (not provided or invalid) or the author/user of the terminology wants to override or set default values despite (or in addition to) what is provided in the source file. This can be accomplished using &#34;manifest&#34; files along with the source file.
<h4 id="LexBIG1.0.2InstallationandAdministrationGuide-HowdowecreateaCodingSchemeManifestfile?">
  How do we create a Coding Scheme Manifest file?
</h4>
A coding scheme manifest file is a valid XML file, conforming to the schema defined by
<a href="http://LexGrid.org/schema/LexBIG/2007/01/CodingSchemeManifestList.xsd" rel="nofollow">
  http://LexGrid.org/schema/LexBIG/2007/01/CodingSchemeManifestList.xsd
</a>
. This XML file can define values for one or more coding schemes you are dealing with. Some coding scheme meta-information may not easily map to information in the source file. In this case a manifest file is of great help to bridge the gap and control the information flow while mapping to the LexGrid model. A detailed model of the LexGrid Coding Scheme and its fields can be found online. Structure of the schema for the manifest file is explained in the following table (manifest components refer to the original LexGrid model schema namespaces and types):
<ul>
  <li>
    Coding Scheme Manifest entry field: id
    <ul>
      <li>
        Type: lgCommon:registeredName
      </li>
      <li>
        Required: Yes
      </li>
      <li>
        Override flag set: Not applicable
      </li>
      <li>
        Description:
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
The registered name is the key used to find a coding scheme (for example a unique URL or namespace by which other people access same coding scheme). This String value will be used to identify the manifest entry in the manifest file for the coding scheme too. For example the registered name for coding scheme &#34;Amino-acid&#34; is
<a href="http://www.co-ode.org/ontologies/amino-acid/2006/05/18/amino-acid.owl" rel="nofollow">
  http://www.co-ode.org/ontologies/amino-acid/2006/05/18/amino-acid.owl#
</a>
. This string is also set as the coding scheme&#39;s registered name field in the LexGrid model.

  What Code Changes May Be Required To Use a Manifest File?
</h4>
If you want to use the manifest file, you can supply the manifest file URI to the following methods when Loading NCI OWL or generic OWL Loads:
<ul>
  <li>
    org.LexGrid.LexBIG.Extensions.Load.OWL_Loader.load()
  </li>
  <li>
    org.LexGrid.LexBIG.Extensions.Load.OWL_Loader.validate()
  </li>
</ul>
An example code snippet:
LexBIGService lbs = new LexBIGServiceImpl();
LexBIGServiceManager lbsm = lbs.getServiceManager(null);
OWL_Loader loader = (OWL_Loader) lbsm.getLoader(&#34;OWLLoader&#34;);

if (toValidateOnly)
\{
loader.validate(source, manifest, vl);
System.out.println(&#34;VALIDATION SUCCESSFUL&#34;);
\}
else
\{

cid.owl&#34;).toURI(),
new File(&#34;resources/testData/aa-manifest.xml&#34;).toURI(),true,
true);
\}

For all other manifest loads the following methods are employed.
// Find the registered extension handling this type of load

LexBIGService lbs = new LexBIGServiceImpl();

LexBIGServiceManager lbsm = lbs.getServiceManager(null);

HL7_Loader loader = (HL7_Loader)lbsm.getLoader(org.LexGrid.LexBIG.Impl.loaders.HL7LoaderImpl.name);

// updated to include manifest

loader.setCodingSchemeManifestURI(manifest);

// updated to include loader preferences

loader.setLoaderPreferences(loaderPrefs);

loader.load(dbPath, stopOnErrors, true);

  Loader Preferences
</h3>
LexBIG loaders allow custom configuration using a loader preferences file. Loader preferences are limited in functionality and scope at present. The loaders for HL7 RIM, NCI Metathesaurus, UMLS SEMNET and NCI OWL currently support some loader preferences.HL7 RIM and NCI MetaThesaurus both allow Metadata file location load preferences that provide customization of the location of the Metadata file generated by a loader by user option. The NCI OWL loader provides preferences for prioritizing comments, presentations and definitions within NCI OWL loads. Also provided is customization of a number of otherwise hardcoded values in the NCI OWL Loader. UMLS SEMNET preferences provides a range of inheritance values that determines whether inferred inheritance values are loaded or not. The range of customizable values are defined in the xsd schema files in the lbModel project available from the LexEVS project EVS on Gforge.MetaThesaurus and HL7 metadata file locations are defined in the LoaderPreferences.xsd file as follows:
&lt;xs:schema xmlns=&#34;http://LexGrid.org/LexBIG/LoadPreferences&#34; targetNamespace=&#34;http://LexGrid.org/LexBIG/LoadPreferences&#34; elementFormDefault=&#34;qualified&#34; xmlns:xs=&#34;http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema&#34;&gt;

Loader preferences for a given loader can be loaded from a file in the following format example for the NCI OWL loader.
&lt;OWLLoaderPreferences xmlns:basePreferences=&#34;http://LexGrid.org/LexBIG/LoadPreferences&#34;&gt;

&lt;MatchConceptCode&gt;currency&lt;/MatchConceptCode&gt;

&lt;PrioritizedCommentNames&gt;
&lt;name&gt;units&lt;/name&gt;
&lt;/PrioritizedCommentNames&gt;

&lt;PrioritizedDefinitionNames&gt;
&lt;name&gt;max&lt;/name&gt;
&lt;/PrioritizedDefinitionNames&gt;

&lt;PrioritizedPresentationNames&gt;
&lt;name&gt;currency&lt;/name&gt;
&lt;/PrioritizedPresentationNames&gt;

&lt;/OWLLoaderPreferences&gt;

Preferences are pulled into code used to wrap a loading process in the following manner:
	// Find the registered extension handling this type of load ...
			LexBIGService lbs = LexBIGServiceImpl.defaultInstance();
			LexBIGServiceManager lbsm = lbs.getServiceManager(null);

OWL_Loader loader = (OWL_Loader) lbsm.getLoader(org.LexGrid.
LexBIG.Impl.loaders.OWLLoaderImpl.name);

			// Perform the requested load or validate action ...
			if (vl &gt;= 0) {
				loader.validateNCI(source, manifest, vl);
				Util.displayTaggedMessage(&#34;VALIDATION SUCCESSFUL&#34;);
			} else {
if (loaderPrefs != null)
loader.setLoaderPreferences(loaderPrefs);
loader.loadNCI(source, manifest, memorySafe, stopOnErrors, true);
				Util.displayLoaderStatus(loader);
			}
Variable loaderPrefs is a path to a preferences file.

  Preliminary Considerations
</h4>
Before You BeginThis section provides an overview of the components as related to system adminstration, backup, and recovery. Individual organizations may have there own backup and diaster recovery procedure.
<h4 id="LexBIG1.0.2InstallationandAdministrationGuide-DatabaseInstallation">
  Database Installation
</h4>
Database systems as described in the section Required Software—Not Included in LexBIG provide the storage for vocabularies loaded into LexBIG. For each vocabulary version loaded into LexBIG a new database is created. As defined in the config.props files the db_prefix variable is used to create the database name.For example with db_prefix=lexbig, each new vocabulary version that is loaded a new database is created using an incremental counter.
<ul>
  <li>
    lexbig1
  </li>
  <li>
    lexbig2
  </li>
  <li>
    lexbig3
  </li>
  <li>
    lexbigN
  </li>
</ul>
Depending on backup strategy, system administrators will need to be aware that multiple databases are being created and may need backup procedures to meet servicability and recovery requirements for your organization.
<h4 id="LexBIG1.0.2InstallationandAdministrationGuide-LexBIGInstallation">
  LexBIG Installation
</h4>
The LexBIG software, documentation, indexes, and system logs are located in the {LEXBIG_DIRECTORY} (e.g., /usr/local/packages/LexBIG or c:\lexbig). These files may be part of the local file system and may require backup procedures to meet servicability and recovery requirements for your organization.LexBIG uses basic database indexes, but also includes a separate indexing facility using Apache Lucene. Lucene Index files are stored in a directory as specified in the config.props file index_location variable.

      <td>
        Installed by default. This directory provides a centralized point for command line scripts that can be executed to perform administrative functions such as the loading, activation/deactivation, and removal of vocabulary resources. Object code used to carry out these functions is included directly in the LexBIG runtime components. Source code is included in the /source directory in the lbAdmin-src.jar (described below).

        Optionally installed. This directory provides a small number of example programs. Refer to the README.txt file in this directory for instructions used to configure and run the example programs. The examples are intended to provide a limited interactive demonstration of LexBIG capabilities. Source and object code for the example programs is provided under the /examples/org subdirectory. Source materials are also centrally archived under the /source directory in the file lbExamples-src.jar.

        /gui
      </td>
      <td>
        Optionally installed. This folder contains programs and supporting files to launch the LexBIG Graphical User Interface (GUI). The GUI provides convenient centralized access to administrative functions as well as support to test and exercise most of the LexBIG API. The GUI is launched using a platform-specific script file in the /gui directory. The name of the platform (e.g. Windows, OSX, etc) is included in the file name. Program source and related materials are centrally archived under the /source directory in the file lbGUI-src.jar.

    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>
        /resources
      </td>
      <td>
        Installed by default. This directory contains resources referenced and written directly by the LexBIG runtime. It should, in general, be considered off-limits to modify or remove the content of this directory without specific guidance and reason to do so. Files typically stored to this location include the vocabulary registry (tracking certain metadata for installed content) and indexes used to facilitate query over the installed content.   One file of particular interest in this directory is the /resources/config/config.props file. This file controls access to the database repository and other settings used to tune the LexBIG runtime behavior. Contents of this file should be set according to instructions provided by the LexBIG Administrator&#39;s Guide.

      </td>
      <td>
        Installed by default. This directory contains a Java archive (.jar) file containing the combined object code of the LexBIG runtime, LexBIG administrative interfaces, and any additional code they are dependent on. All required code for execution of LexBIG administrative and runtime services is installed to this directory.
        <ul>
          <li>
            /runtime/lbPatch.jar  In the course of the product lifecycle, it is possible that smaller fixes will be introduced as a patch to the initially distributed runtime. Including this file in the classpath ensures automatic accessibility to the calling program without requiring adjustment. All patches are cumulative (there is at most one patch file introduced per release; all patch-level fixes are cumulative).
          </li>
          <li>
            /runtime/lbRuntime.jar  This is the standard runtime file, including all LexBIG and dependency code required for program execution except for SQL drivers (see next).

    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>
        /runtime  /sqldrivers
      </td>
      <td>
        The JDBC drivers used to connect to database repositories are not included in the lbRuntime.jar. Instead, the runtime scans this directory for the drivers to include. This can be overridden by path settings in the config.props file.NoteWhile the LexBIG software package ships with JDBC drivers to certain open source databases such as mySQL and PostgreSQL, this folder provides a mechanism to introduce updated drivers or to add drivers for additional supported database systems. For example, the Oracle database is supported by the runtime environment. However, the drivers are not redistributed with the LexBIG software. To run against Oracle, an administrator would add a jar with the appropriate JDBC driver to this directory and then reference it in the config.props settings.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>
        /runtime-components
      </td>
      <td>
        Optionally installed. Due to license considerations for additional materials (as described by the license.pdf and license.txt files in the install directory), the cumulative runtime provided in the lbRuntime.jar is not redistributable. This directory contains a finer grain breakdown of object code into logical components and 3rd party inclusions. All components are redistributable under their own license agreements, which are provided along with each archive. The top-level of the /runtime-components directory contains all code produced for the LexBIG project in the lexbig.jar.NoteThese files are included as an alternative to the lbRuntime.jar for code execution and redistribution. There is no need to include any of these files in the Java classpath if you are already including the lbPatch.jar and lbRuntime.jar described above.

  Appendix II: LexBIG GUI Admin Tool
</h2>
If you choose to install the LexBIG GUI when you installed LexBIG - you will have a &#39;gui&#39; folder inside of your LexBIG base installation. If you installed the GUI for all operating systems, you should have the following programs
<ul>
  <li>
    Linux_64-lbGUI.sh
  </li>
  <li>
    Linux-lbGUI.sh
  </li>
  <li>
    OSX-lbGUI.command
  </li>
  <li>
    Windows-lbGUI.bat
  </li>
  <li>
    Windows-lbGUI -browser.bat
  </li>
</ul>
We provide two Windows shell script versions which allow a choice between the full fledged loading, managing and &#34;end use&#34; or &#34;end use&#34; only type interfaces.This shell script provides an example by which any shell script can pass an argument option &#34;-d&#34; into the java command launching the LexBIG GUI application, restricting the end user to browsing only and allowing no loading or management of terminologies.Launch the GUI by executing the appropriate script for your platform. You will be presented with an application that looks like the following figure:
<img alt="example screenshot of the LexBIG GUI" src="https://wiki.nci.nih.gov/download/attachments/embedded-page/LexEVS/LexBIG%201.0.2%20Installation%20and%20Administration%20Guide/LexBIG_GUI.jpg?api=v2">
This application will let you perform most administrative functions that are available in the LexBIG API. To enable the administrative functions, first, go to the &#39;Commands&#39; menu, and then click on the &#39;Enable Admin Options&#39; submenu. This will enable all of the commands that can make changes to the LexBIG environment.This guide will only cover the administrative commands - please refer to the programmers guide for instructions on the rest of the LexBIG GUI.Each administrative command is described in turn in the following tables, starting with the menus.Commands Menu
