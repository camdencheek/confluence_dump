  Applications and Extensions for LexEVS Local Runtime
</h2>
Start here to install additional functional capabilities to a local runtime. These additional features are deployed and run within the same Java Virtual Machine (JVM) as the LexEVS local runtime environment. Registered extensions can be discovered programatically through the LexEVS API. HL7 CTS Extension   Provides an alternative API to discover and access vocabulary resources loaded into a LexEVS Local Runtime. API interfaces conform to the HL7 Common Terminology Services (CTS) version 1.2 specification.
