The following describes the Logical Model Changes.

Changes Made to LexGrid Logical Model for 2010/01:
<ul>
  <li>
    Package ValueSets :
    <ul>
      <li>
        Renamed element ValueDomainDefinition to ValueSetDefinition and container ValueDomains to ValueSets. GForge # 27021.
      </li>
      <li>
        Added attribute &#39;conceptDomain&#39; of type &#39;conceptDomain&#39; to class &#39;valueSetDefinition&#39; to support CTS 2 SFM.
      </li>
      <li>
        Added class &#39;propertyReference&#39; and &#39;propertyMatchValue&#39; to support CTS 2 SFM.
        <ul>
          <li>
            propetyReference contains : &#39;codingScheme&#39;(Required), &#39;propertyName&#39;, &#39;propertyMatchValue&#39;
          </li>
          <li>
            propertyMatchValue extends from &#39;text&#39; and contains attribute &#39;matchAlgorithm&#39;
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        Made &#39;definitionEntry&#39; versionable to support CTS 2 SFM.
      </li>
      <li>
        Made class &#39;valueSetDefinition&#39; and &#39;pickListDefinition&#39; as entry point. This change allows to load and export Value Set Definition and Pick List Definition individually.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>
    Package Naming:
    <ul>
      <li>
        Added &#39;supportedConceptDomain&#39; to support CTS 2 SFM.
      </li>
      <li>
        Added attributes &#39;codingScheme&#39;, &#39;entityCodeNamespace&#39; and &#39;entityCode&#39; to &#39;SupportedAssociation&#39;. This was added to make it earier to get an AssociationEntity instance for a given associationPredicate.
      </li>
      <li>
        Added attribute &#39;propertyType&#39; to &#39;SupportedProperty&#39;. This provides an easy way to find all supportedProperties information by propertyType which are &#39;presentation&#39;,&#39;definition&#39;,&#39;comment&#39; and &#39;property&#39;. NCI requirement Gforge # 24699.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>
    Package CommonTypes:
    <ul>
      <li>
        Added &#39;conceptDomain&#39; in localIds. Since ConceptDomain has been added to the model, we will need to maintain all the ConceptDomain used in the system in our SupportedAttributes mappings.
      </li>
      <li>
        Changed &#39;owner&#39; in &#39;versionable&#39; from &#39;source&#39; to &#39;tsCaseIgnoreIA5String&#39;. This was changed since other attributes of Source were never used.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>
    Package Concept:
    <ul>
      <li>
        Removed elements &#39;Concept&#39; and &#39;Instance&#39;. These first class elements are not required anymore as an &#39;Entity&#39; can represent either &#39;concept&#39; or &#39;instance&#39; or any other type by specifying it in its EntityType.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>
    Package Relations:
    <ul>
      <li>
        Made class &#39;relation&#39; versionable to Support CTS 2 SFM.
      </li>
      <li>
        Added &#39;isMapping&#39;, &#39;sourceCodingScheme&#39;, &#39;sourceCodingSchemeVersion&#39;, &#39;targetCodingScheme&#39;, &#39;targetCodingSchemeVersion&#39; to class &#39;relation&#39; to support loading of MRMAP RRF file.
      </li>
      <li>
        Added &#39;properties&#39; container to &#39;relation&#39; container to supported loading of MRMAP RRF file.
      </li>
      <li>
        Removed &#39;isNative&#39; and &#39;source&#39; from &#39;relation&#39; as they were never used.
      </li>
      <li>
        Added new class &#39;associationPredicate&#39; with required attribute &#39;associationName&#39; to supported loading of MRMAP RRF file.
      </li>
      <li>
        Renamed class &#39;association&#39; to &#39;associationEntity&#39;. Removed all Booleans except &#39;isTransitive&#39;, and &#39;isNavigable. And made &#39;associationEntity&#39; subclass of &#39;Entity&#39;. This change was also made to supported loading of MRMAP RRF file.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>
    Package Versions:
    <ul>
      <li>
        Changed &#39;changeAgent&#39; in class &#39;revision&#39; from &#39;source&#39; to &#39;tsCaseIgnoreIA5String&#39; as none of the &#39;Source&#39; attributes were used.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
