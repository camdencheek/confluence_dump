. Some of the vocabularies within the NCI Metathesaurus are subject to license restrictions, so all users who wish to download these files must have a license from the UMLS and provide their credentials before downloading. For those users who download the NCI Metathesaurus from the NCI EVS download site, the procedure for submitting license information has changed.The UMLS recently (January, 2011) changed the requirements for providing credentials and NCI EVS has been required to update their download site to comply. It is no longer necessary to provide your UMLS license number for downloading the NCI Metathesaurus; instead you will be prompted for the username and password for your UMLS account.
