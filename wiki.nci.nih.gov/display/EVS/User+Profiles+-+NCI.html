EVS has supported DCB research on mouse and other animal models of cancer for more than 10 years. EVS has helped develop and maintain accurate coding and classification terminology for animal models, and has worked with NCI and community partners to develop accurate mappings between terminologies currently in use. Key NCI components of this effort are described here, while community partners are described later

.Mouse Models of Human Cancer Consortium (MMHCC) was established by NCI in 1999 to accelerate the development and validation of mouse models by the scientific community. When the MMHCC was initiated, one of the early projects was to create a repository of curated information about animal models that have been employed in cancer studies, called the Cancer Models Database (now caMOD). EVS staff participated in developing the classifications of mouse diagnoses used for annotating the mouse models, and provided support for additional terminology such as strains and anatomy. All of this terminology has been incorporated into NCI Thesaurus (NCIt), used by caMOD and other users through both browser and programming interfaces. caMOD annotates information with NCIt terminology, and uses the LexEVS API directly to generate anatomy and diagnosis tree hierarchies. 400 concepts were added or updated for caMOD in the last-recorded six month period.EVS has supported periodic updates to this animal model terminology, and has extended terminology support to cover rats and zebrafish, using existing community standards where available:
<ul>
  <li>
    International Harmonization of Rat Nomenclature (RENI) was used as the foundation for the Terminology of Rat Pathologic Diagnoses in NCI Thesaurus (NCIt).
  </li>
  <li>
    Zebrafish Information Network (ZFIN) zebrafish anatomy is provided as a standalone terminology in EVS systems including the

  </li>
</ul>
MMHCC has merged with the Mouse Repository at Frederick National Research Laboratories, which provides mouse cancer models and associated strains, live and cryopreserved. Additional future support for updating the diagnosis terminology to reflect new models is anticipated.For more information, visit the

DCCPS collaboration includes several terminology projects related to cancer classification, drugs, chemotherapy regimens, and statistics. DCCPS is currently launching a new initiative on standardized terminology for population health data collection.Portfolio Management Application (PMA-DCCPS): EVS has worked with DCCPS for a number of years to integrate PMA-DCCPS grant coding terminology with other EVS resources. NCIt now includes more than 1,500 concepts for PMA grant coding. PMA terms are also inserted and appear in the NCI Metathesaurus as a separate terminology.

  Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE)
</h3>
CTCAE, created by CTEP in 1983, is used throughout the entire oncology community as the standard classification and severity grading scale for adverse events in cancer therapy clinical trials and other oncology settings. It is also used in a number of non-oncology trials and settings.Version 4, released in May 2009, is a major update based on extensive international participation by stakeholders and experts. It is harmonized with MedDRA at the Adverse Event (AE) level, includes revised AE terms and severity indicators to reflect clinical effects identified with current oncology interventions, and was selected as a caBIG® vocabulary standard. This version is used by more than 50 academic and research organizations, as well as many commercial and non-profit organizations. Five different Apple applications utilize the NCI Thesaurus version of the CTCAE data, and cite NCIt as the source.CTCAE is designed to integrate into information networks for safety data exchange, and plays a major role in data management for AE data collection, analysis, and patient outcomes associated with cancer research and care. EVS played a central role in designing and managing this effort, working closely with CTEP, DCP, caBIG®, the FDA, and many participants from the broader community. The revision was developed and deployed using various EVS tools including the BiomedGT Wiki, Protégé editing tools, LexEVS terminology server, NCI Term Browser, and the

    initiative. EVS has used PDQ terminology as a core component of its NCI Thesaurus (NCIt) reference terminology, and has worked to harmonize with and add to PDQ terminology even as NCIt was extended in many ways not required for PDQ itself. EVS took over and carries on efforts to harmonize and cross-link both PDQ terminology and NCIt with other NCI coding terminologies including CTEP disease and adverse event terminologies, NCI Developmental Therapeutics Program drug terms, and terminology from DCCPS and DCP. EVS continues to work with OCPL on strengthening PDQ terminology as a coding and information retrieval resource. See

Cooperative Human Tissue Bank (CHTB):  EVS has supported terminology creation and editing for this network of research institutions, established by the NCI Cancer Diagnosis Program in 1987 and now including six divisions located at Vanderbilt, U. Penn, UAB School of Medicine, Nationwide Children&#39;s Hospital, Ohio State, University of Virginia. CHTB hosts NCI funded tissue facilities and services providing remnant human tissue and fluids from routine procedures to investigators. There is active use by 14 academic and research organizations and eight (8) commercial organizations. EVS staff assisted with matching up terminology used by these groups to NCIt terminology, creating new NCIt concepts and definitions as needed.Cancer Central Clinical Database (C3D): EVS provides support for C3D, largely through providing the new and updated terminology and definitions for case report forms. C3D currently supports electronic submission of clinical trials data to the NCI Clinical Data System (CDS) and the Clinical Trials Monitoring Service (CTMS/Theradex).OPEN (Oncology Patient Enrollment Network): This web-based registration system for patient enrollments onto NCI-sponsored Cooperative Group clinical trials is a highly active project; most terminology supplied for this is standard demographic terminology.
