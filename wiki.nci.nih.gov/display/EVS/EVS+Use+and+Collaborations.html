NCI Enterprise Vocabulary Services (EVS) provides resources and services to meet NCI needs for controlled terminology. NCI needs for terminology content, standards and systems are often shared by other NIH institutes and federal agencies, and by the broader cancer research and biomedical community. Since 1997, EVS has worked with many partners to build shared content and services, so that information can be exchanged, interpreted and analyzed while reducing total effort and cost. EVS is widely used:
<ul>
  <li>
    By NCI, NIH, federal agencies, and other U.S. and international biomedical, academic, standards and research organizations
  </li>
  <li>
    To create, extend, subset, map, access and publish biomedical terminology and ontology
  </li>
  <li>
    For basic, translational, and clinical research, clinical care, epidemiology, public health, administration, and public information.
  </li>
</ul>
These pages describe many of the users and uses of EVS resources and services, almost all of which are freely available without restriction.
