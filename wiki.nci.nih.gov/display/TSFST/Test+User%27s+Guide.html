.When an image is uploaded to TCIA, it is not made public immediately. A curator takes it through a quality control process to ensure that no private patient data is available, the image is of good quality, and so forth. Using the Perform Quality Control tool as a curator, you can define search criteria to locate image series for you to evaluate. You can then evaluate the submission and assign the QC (quality control) status to an image or image series.




Visibility of Image Series

The Perform Quality Control tool allows a curator to search &#34;non-visible&#34; or &#34;not reviewed&#34; image series, whereas a regular user using the search tool can only see approved public image series.

<h3 id="TestUser&#39;sGuide-UsingtheDynamicSearch">
  Using the Dynamic Search
</h3>
The dynamic search adds all of the available DICOM fields to your search query options. The dynamic search filters available to you are divided into those you can&#39;t select (because they are already part of the basic search filters) and those you can select to add to your search. The first subset of filters, with the blue headers, are selectable. The second subset of filters, with the green headers, are not selectable because they are already part of the basic search criteria along the left side of the window. You can combine dynamic search filters with basic search filters to create a more specific query. Each dynamic search filter can be made even more specific with your selection of a Boolean operator. These operators are And, Or, and Omit. These operators determine the logic of the combination of a dynamic filter with the basic filters.




Example

If you wanted to find the image series that have been confirmed as complete for a patient ID for which you only want to enter the first few characters, you would select Yes in the Confirmed as Complete basic search filter on the left, then click
<img alt="Dynamic Search tab" width="125" src="https://wiki.nci.nih.gov/download/attachments/embedded-page/TSFST/Test%20User&#39;s%20Guide/DynamicSearchButton.png?api=v2">
, and select And and Starts With in the Patient ID dynamic search filter. This opens the Patient ID box on the left, where you would enter the first few characters of the patient ID and click Apply. The search results combining these two filters appear immediately in the main window.
