  Goals
</h2>
CBIIT would like a unified UI across CRDC and get the architecture into a similar place. The PDC team can analyze the gap between functionalities in Bento vs PDC portal. Is it feasible to recreate PDC in Bento? We would like the PDC team to generate a simple report with challenges/risks by end of February, 2021.
