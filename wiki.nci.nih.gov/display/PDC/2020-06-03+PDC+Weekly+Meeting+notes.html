        Showed PowerPoint.  Weekly Visits, users, pageviews, pages/session, avg. session duration, bounce rate (lower the better) - users who come, but don&#39;t navigate further.  Looked at country distribution.  Also showed landmarks timeline.  Mike MacCoss interrupted Henry as he was asking about how to know if these statistics are valuable (concern about relationship).  If someone is taking the content from PDC, how do we know if they are crediting us?  License for the data - CCBY.  How to count on another portal that they&#39;ve used data from the PDC portal?  Spent the majority of time on analytics.  More discussion of license and may need a more detailed discussion.  How do we ensure the data that gets released gets credit without creating a huge burden?

        Henry asked about download issues with HNSCC.  Mike Holck addressed - pushed new version of portal.  Access keys rotated per normal process.  Code went back to old access key (cached value) - unknown as to why.  Replicated on Stage and updated script to force update of keys in code.  Added to test group that a push to prod tests download standard.

        Henry doesn&#39;t feel he&#39;s a stakeholder, but the community.  Has PDC thought of putting together a focus group of users not familiar with the website to get feedback?  MacCoss thought that was a good idea also to get more contribution of data.  Involve Scientific Committee in figuring out best approach to tackle this problem.  Paul mentioned recording users and understanding how they work.Erika mentioned that CRDC has been launched as MVP (soft launch).  Looking for feedback.  Public announcement will be next week.
