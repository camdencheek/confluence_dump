        Ingest, curate, qualify, store, harmonize, analyze, visualize, and distribute proteomic data and associated metadata.
      </li>
      <li>
        Work with the PDC Advisory Committee to identify and ingest publicly available proteomic datasets that would be advantageous to house at the PDC.  Additionally, work with the PDC Advisory Committee to establish development, data, and operational priorities.
      </li>
      <li>
        Foster interoperability with other CRDC nodes through participation in CRDC projects such as the Cancer Data Aggregator and Center for Cancer Data Harmonization (CCDH) by establishing a PDC data model and vocabulary that can be mapped to those of other CRDC nodes. Work with the PDC Advisory Committee, CCDH, and other community groups to select, define, incorporate and support existing standards for proteomic data and metadata.
      </li>
      <li>
        Support a cloud-based system.  Data on CRDC nodes will be spread across multiple cloud providers and the PDC shall incorporate community standards to allow search and analysis in a cloud provider agnostic manner.  The
        <a href="https://www.ga4gh.org/" rel="nofollow">
          Global Alliance for Genomics and Health
        </a>
         (GA4GH) is an international organization aimed at making genomic data usable on a wide scale and both the GDC and the DCF are driving projects of GA4GH.  Since the PDC is a cloud-based system, users must be able to access data housed at the PDC from a variety of cloud locations.  This level of interoperability will be especially vital for users of the CRDC Cloud Resources.  These efforts will likely revolve around implementing community standards to promote cross-provider search and analysis.  As a demonstration of this interoperability, the PDC will be expected to demonstrate that PDC managed data can be consumed by any user who has been properly authenticated and authorized, including from systems outside of the PDC itself.  It should be noted that the PDC must be designed to prevent, minimize, or charge back to the end user egress charges for data stored at PDC.
      </li>
      <li>
        Coordinate with and making use of other CRDC components, including, but not limited to: Genomic Data Commons, Cloud Resources, Imaging Data Commons, and Data Commons Framework as they become available.

      <li>
        Implement Fence.
        <a href="https://github.com/uc-cdis/fence" rel="nofollow">
          Fence
        </a>
         is the CRDC standard for Authentication and Authorization (A&amp;A) and while the PDC is expected to utilize public, uncontrolled data initially, the PDC may need to support A&amp;A for non-public or controlled datasets and does need to ensure interoperability with the CRDC.  Therefore, the PDC  shall implement Fence for the PDC production release.
      </li>
      <li>
        Implement IndexD.
        <a href="https://github.com/uc-cdis/indexd)" rel="nofollow">
          IndexD
        </a>
         is the CRDC standard for data indexing and tracking.  This system provides globally unique identifiers for all data objects in the CRDC and a mapping to the physical location of the object.  Additionally, IndexD provides an alias service that allows mapping of additional identifiers to the globally unique ID so that human readable identifiers can be used without compromising the utility of the globally unique ID.  The PDC shall use IndexD to index all data managed by the PDC.
      </li>
      <li>
        Develop, curate, and support analysis pipelines in collaboration with Cloud Resources.  The PDC shall apply a “Common Data Analysis Pipeline” (CDAP) to all mass-spectrometry-based proteomic data sets.  The goal of the CDAP is to enable cross-comparison of datasets at multiple levels, including, but not limited to: peptide, protein, post-translation modification, and quality.
      </li>
      <li>
        Facilitate submission of proteomic-based analysis pipelines and software tools to CRDC, in collaboration with Cloud Resources.  The PDC shall enable and promote use of such pipelines and tools through the user interface and API’s.
      </li>
      <li>
        Facilitate use of workspaces.  A workspace is a private storage space where access is controlled by the user.  Synonymous names include “sandbox” and “jamboree site.”  Users invite their collaborators to the workspace to share data.  When ready for publication, the data are already housed in the PDC (or a space accessible by the PDC) and can be easily transferred to the PDC’s public portal.  The PDC shall implement any standards necessary for PDC data to be included in CRDC workspaces. This may be in the form of feature annotations and/or pointers to source data. This effort is aimed at allowing users to store more easily their own data and results from analyses at CRDC nodes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Establish a helpdesk, documentation, and community outreach to support users as they learn how to use PDC and to collect feedback and user stories to drive future development.
      </li>
      <li>
        Improve user experience.  The PDC shall have end-users perform acceptance testing and provide feedback and use cases for future development.  The PDC shall evaluate usage analytics, direct feedback, and other means of feedback to continually improve the user experience.  The PDC shall maintain a prioritized list of requested features and seek to increase the use cases for which the PDC is able to fulfill.

      <li>
        Provide a shared area for pre-public CPTAC data.  This area is accessible only to CPTAC investigators and allows for processing and analysis of the data.  As the PDC matures, the function of shared area should be provided through PDC workspaces.  The DCC works closely with CPTAC data producers and analysts to ensure completeness, accuracy, availability, security, and accessibility of the data.
