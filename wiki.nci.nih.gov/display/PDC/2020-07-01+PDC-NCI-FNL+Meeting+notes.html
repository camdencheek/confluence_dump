        updates on Scientific Committee.  Waiting on one response (Oliver Boghler), but others have accepted.  Question as to whether we want to invite one additional member (Eric Deutsch).  Next step is to setup meeting.  If no response from Oliver, forward again (cc: Henry) and Henry will call.

        Other items:Gygi dataset is not shared anywhere - good opportunity to share an important data set.  Heard from them and they are willing to submit.  Ron Taylor from ISB wants this data.  Some of this data is scattered across other commons (Broad, GDC?)What is the metric used to determine the quality of the analytics?  Usually want comprehensive data sets - how do you know extent of a data set if it&#39;s scattered?  Will this cause quality of standards to go down?  Common data pipeline shows metrics regarding consistency and quality.  Publication counts as a metric.  Proteo-genomics is a focus, but genomics is not necessarily a requirement for data inclusion.  Still keeping a pretty cancer focus - not just taking any data from any organism.  Value comes from analysis itself.  Feedback from analysis would be nice.  Even data sets that are not such high quality can be valuable to show the level of further research needed.  John suggests that too much noise can detract and the metrics can show the noise level.  Suggestion to include a data governance advisory board to preview data and determine priority (similar to ICDC).  Make sure we don&#39;t become dbGaP and accept just anything.  Quality metrics are critical.  Discussion around putting genomic data in CDS if there is no other home.SBG will be invited to future meeting to demo what they can do for PDC.New URL is up and working (proteomic.datacommons.cancer.gov/pdc).  Uses a redirect.Received query from AACR - let group know about it and that PDC will answer further questions.CCDH - worked with them on Aggregated Data Model.  No action items at this time.  They are still in information gathering mode.  Impacts to be determined later.CRDC all hands meeting last two days.  CCDH, CDA new nodes in CRDC.  Will impact PDC, but no action items at this time.
