          <li>
            Eric D asked about PDC interactions with CRDC. There is an active coordination between PDC and CRDC since the PDC design and build phase and will continue in future.
          </li>
          <li>
            There is a question from Alexy N about the scalability of cloud to index large proteomic datasets to enable fast searches. Alexy N pointed that in their experience cloud is not really scalable due to high memory (RAM) and high cost involved to generate indices. Bing mentioned that PepQuery is now uses S3 to store the prebuilt databases for searching. PDC is currently not hosting tools that access raw data in real time that need indexing of these files, but this can be explored if these tools are of interest can be prioritized through SC discussions.
          </li>
          <li>
            Amanda P raised the use case of simplifying the interface to help clinicians to help answer questions like if a protein or gene of their interest play a role in drug resistance in their datasets.
          </li>
          <li>
            Oliver B echoed similar views to have use cases that support biologists.
          </li>
          <li>
            Henry R suggested to work towards having focus groups outside of PDC that help strategize simplifying the user interface to support the use cases such as Amanda P and Oliver B pointing out.
          </li>
          <li>
            Bing Z asked APIs and PDC has whole suite of APIs to access both data and metadata.
          </li>
          <li>
            Due to shortage of time, the last session data harmonization by Paul Rudnick was not covered in this call. It will be part of the next SC call agenda.
