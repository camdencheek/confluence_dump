        A demo of the Study versioning was done and Erika had a question if a search by Study Id can bring up the Study details.Rajesh indicated the feature for this Search has been implemented.Michael H spoke about the PFB file manifest that follows the GA4GH standards implementation and how we are working on the DRS url and Firecloud adding that to their whitelist. This will allow users to easily transfer files across AWS to Google Cloud without having to download the large files locally. This is a good step towards integrating with GCS.The team had a good exercise working on defining Personas with the Comms team. This will lead to establishing user group followed by conducting interviews to collect feedback for the portal.Mike MacCoss was suggesting working with Amanda Pavlovich since she has the Cancer clinician in addition to CPTAC and MS expertise. We can keep improving the data access to Data Scientists and Bioinformaticists. Learning more from the audience will be good.Erika shared with the group about the ProteomeXchange meeting she attended and learned about how other groups work.
