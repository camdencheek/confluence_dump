  Performing Searches
</h2>
NBIA enables you to search for images in the local NBIA in vivo image repository. If available, you can also search remote imaging archives.NBIA is designed to perform the following tasks:
<ul>
  <li>
    Search for images in simple or advanced search mode
  </li>
  <li>
    Combine search criteria defined in those searches with keyword searches of curated annotation data
  </li>
  <li>
    Save the search queries to be used repeatedly
  </li>
  <li>
    Review query histories
  </li>
</ul>
As subjects, studies, series or images are located, save them to your data basket for download.Downloading series with annotation filesWhen you download a series that has annotation files (indicated by Yes in the Contains Annotations column), they are automatically downloaded as well.NBIA submissions are organized in the following hierarchy, which is important to remember in creating your search query and reviewing search results:
<table>
  <colgroup>
    <col/>
  </colgroup>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <th>
        Collection &gt; Patient (Subject) &gt; Study &gt; Series &gt; Images
      </th>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
NBIA provides three search modes:

  Performing a Simple Search
</h3>
A simple search allows you to search for image studies based on a combination of the following search filters: Collection(s), Image Modality(ies), Anatomical Site, Manufacturer Model(s), Available date, Subject IDs, and Baseline Plus. The more criteria you select, the fewer results you receive. After you select your search criteria, you can create a saved query to use later.To perform a simple search

    On the NBIA home page, click Simple Search or Search Images &gt; Simple Search. The Simple Search page appears.

  Performing a Text Search
</h3>
A text search allows for searching of many of the database text fields, DICOM image tag data, and annotation files that are not available in the Simple search.Â Refer to the
<a href="http://dicom.nema.org/medical/dicom/current/output/html/part06.html#chapter_6" rel="nofollow">
  DICOM Data Dictionary
</a>
Â for tags or field names you can use in a text search. A simple example of a text search is to find all subjects associated with the valueÂ pancreasÂ by typingÂ pancreasÂ in the Text Search box. You can also use theÂ field:searchTermÂ technique; for example,Â Body Part Examined:pancreas. In this example, the colon interprets the DICOM field from the value. Since text search also recognizes DICOM codes, you can also search onÂ 0018,0015:pancreas, which is the DICOM code forÂ Body Part Examined. Additionally, you can use a wildcard search such asÂ Body Part Examined:panc*Â to find all subjects associated with values beginning withÂ panc, includingÂ pancreas,Â pancreatic duct,Â andÂ pancreatic duct and bile duct systems.Text search does have some restrictions. These are:
<ul>
  <li>
    The text string you use must have more than one character. The search won&#39;t return any values if the text string has only one character.
  </li>
  <li>
    Do not use a forward slash (/)Â in your text string.
  </li>
  <li>
    Do not use complex searches with AND or OR statements (text search supports
    <a href="http://lucene.apache.org/core/2_9_4/queryparsersyntax.html" rel="nofollow">
      Lucene syntax
    </a>
    Â but only a single field can be searched at a time).
