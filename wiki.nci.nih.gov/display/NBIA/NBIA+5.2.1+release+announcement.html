. This release is in response to the the Update 45 of Java 7 released by Oracle on October 15, 2013.  The additional signing and security measures within Update 45 cause the download manager within NBIA to malfunction when accessed by users with the latest versions of Java on the client machine.  This update allows the adopters to utilize their own certificates to sign the download manager jar files and JNLP template via the automated build or installer programs to allow download manager to function successfully in with the newest Java clients.
