The manifest file generated by TCIA/NBIA 6.5.3 is now self-contained and only version 3.0 of the Downloader can read it. Please update your Downloader.

You can ignore the double entries. It is likely that you installed an early version of Downloader 2.0 or Downloader 1.0,  which have different upgrade codes internally.  The old software is removed when the new version is installed. If the newly installed application is not functioning as expected, you can manually remove the old one and reinstall the new one. However, it is not required to do so.

Always use the latest version of the application. The Downloader application is backward-compatible. The following table shows the version compatibility between manifest files and the Downloader.

  What is the dependency of the Downloader on Linux and how we can satisfy the dependencies?
</h1>
On CentOS or Red Hat Linux, use the command sudo yum -y install &lt;Downloader Installer Name&gt; to install the Downloader. This command pulls and installs all missing dependent libraries when the Downloader is installed. If you install another way, you may not install all of the dependent libraries. Also, remember that the Downloader always takes a manifest file as a parameter. In a GUI desktop environment, start the Downloader by clicking a manifest file.
<h1 id="DownloaderFAQ-HowdoIruntheDownloaderfromthecommandlineonRedHat/CentOSLinux?">
  How do I run the  Downloader from the command line on RedHat/CentOS Linux?
</h1>
Assuming the Downloader is installed on /opt/Downloader (this is the location that Downloader is installed at when it is installed with command sudo yum -y install Downloader-3.0-1.x86_64.rpm). To run Downloader from the command line, type the command:sudo /opt/Downloader/Downloader &lt;full path of manifest file including the file name&gt;The Downloader always needs to run with a manifest file. Although the application can be invoked from command line, it works best in a desktop environment such as Gnome, KDE, and so on. Once the Downloader is installed in the desktop environment, you can click any manifest file with the extension .tcia to invoke the Downloader.
