A simple search allows you to search for image studies based on a combination of the following search filters: Collection(s), Image Modality(ies), Anatomical Site, Manufacturer Model(s), Available date, Subject IDs, and Baseline Plus. The more criteria you select, the fewer results you receive. After you select your search criteria, you can create a saved query to use later.To perform a simple search

    The Search Results (Studies for Subject) page shows studies associated with the subject that you selected on the Search Results by Subject page. Each study, identified by Study Instance ID, Description, and Date, is followed by a table with rows for each image series in the study. At the top and bottom of the page, breadcrumbs in the format Search &gt;&gt; Study show the level of the data on the page. Clicking Search in those breadcrumbs returns you to your original search results.The following table describes the data available for each study and image series in that study.
