A simple search allows you to search for image studies based on a combination of the following search filters: Collection(s), Image Modality(ies), Anatomical Site, Manufacturer Model(s), Available date, Subject IDs, and Baseline Plus. The more criteria you select, the fewer results you receive. After you select your search criteria, you can create a saved query to use later.To perform a simple search

  Performing a Text Search
</h2>
A text search allows for searching of many of the database text fields, DICOM image tag data, and annotation files that are not available in the Simple search. Refer to the
<a href="http://dicom.nema.org/medical/dicom/current/output/html/part06.html#chapter_6" rel="nofollow">
  DICOM Data Dictionary
</a>
 for tags or field names you can use in a text search. A simple example of a text search is to find all subjects associated with the value pancreas by typing pancreas in the Text Search box. You can also use the field:searchTerm technique; for example, Body Part Examined:pancreas. In this example, the colon interprets the DICOM field from the value. Since text search also recognizes DICOM codes, you can also search on 0018,0015:pancreas, which is the DICOM code for Body Part Examined. Additionally, you can use a wildcard search such as Body Part Examined:panc* to find all subjects associated with values beginning with panc, including pancreas, pancreatic duct, and pancreatic duct and bile duct systems.Text search does have some restrictions. These are:
<ul>
  <li>
    The text string you use must have more than one character. The search won&#39;t return any values if the text string has only one character.
  </li>
  <li>
    Do not use a forward slash (/) in your text string.
  </li>
  <li>
    Do not use complex searches with AND or OR statements (text search supports
    <a href="http://lucene.apache.org/core/2_9_4/queryparsersyntax.html" rel="nofollow">
      Lucene syntax
    </a>
     but only a single field can be searched at a time).

</h2>
The most convenient method of downloading NBIA data is by using the NBIA Data Retriever. You must install the NBIA Data Retriever before you begin downloading data.However, if you cannot download the application, the alternative is to use the TCIA Download Manager, a Java Network Launch Protocol (JNLP) file.The TCIA Download Manager allows you to replicate items in your Data Basket, downloading them to your local machine.  It is a Java program and requires that you install a Java Runtime Environment (JRETM) on your machine to run it. You can

  </a>
  .
</a>
The TCIA Download Manager does not limit the total size of the download.JREYou must have version 8 or higher of the Java Runtime Environment (JRE) installed to be able to open the TCIA Download Manager.
<ul>
  <li>
    If JRE 8 is installed, the TCIA Download Manager attempts to start. To run the application, you must click Run in the Warning dialog box indicating the application&#39;s digital signature cannot be verified. Before doing so, you can select the More Information... link at the bottom of the dialog to view a more detailed report of any security issues. Then you can evaluate whether you want to run the application.
  </li>
  <li>
    If JRE is installed but the version is older than version 6, the browser automatically attempts to upgrade the JRE to version 8.
  </li>
  <li>
    If the JRE is not installed, when you click the Download Manager button, the browser prompts you for what it should do with the JNLP file. The My Data Basket page includes a link to a page where you can download

.When an image is uploaded to NBIA, it is not made public immediately. A curator takes it through a quality control process to ensure that no private patient data is available, the image is of good quality, and so forth. Using the QC tool as a curator, you can define search criteria to locate image series for you to evaluate. You can then evaluate the submission and assign the QC status to an image or image series.QC tool search visibilityThe QC tool allows a curator to search &#34;non-visible&#34; or &#34;not reviewed&#34; images, whereas a regular user using the search tool can only see approved public images.Topics in this section:

.A workflow is a business process that, in the case of NBIA, an image series must pass through before it is published. Since it is a business process, these steps must be defined first within an organization. NBIA allows you to change the visibility status of an image series. This visibility change is part of the definition of a workflow item. Workflow items can also trigger a web service call to a URL. When you define a workflow item, you specify a name for it, the type of action that will take place during it (such as a visibility change), which image collection and site are involved, and the URL of a web service if the information resulting from this workflow item should be sent to one.You can
