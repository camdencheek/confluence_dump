.When an image is uploaded to NBIA, it is not made public immediately. A curator takes it through a quality control process to ensure that no private patient data is available, the image is of good quality, and so forth. Using the QC tool as a curator, you can define search criteria to locate image series for you to evaluate. You can then evaluate the submission and assign the QC status to an image or image series.QC tool search visibilityThe QC tool allows a curator to search &#34;non-visible&#34; or &#34;not reviewed&#34; images, whereas a regular user using the search tool can only see approved public images.Topics in this section:
