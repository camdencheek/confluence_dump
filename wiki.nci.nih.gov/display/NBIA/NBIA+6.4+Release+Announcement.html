<h2 id="NBIA6.4ReleaseAnnouncement-IntegratedUserAuthorizationToolkit">
  Integrated User Authorization Toolkit
</h2>
The CSM/UPT toolkit dependency has been removed from NBIA and has been replaced with an integrated user authorization tool. This has the following benefits:
<ul>
  <li>
    Greatly simplifies installation by no longer requiring the installation and configuration of UPT.
  </li>
  <li>
    Allows access to user authorization directly from within the portal.
  </li>
  <li>
    The tool uses the new paradigm of a REST API hooked into the front end, allowing developers to build their own interfaces with the API,
  </li>
  <li>
    Uses Angular 2 for the front end for a modern look and feel.
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="NBIA6.4ReleaseAnnouncement-ReplacementofJBosswithTomcat">
  Replacement of JBoss with Tomcat
</h2>
NBIA is now run on the Tomcat server. Changing to Tomcat allows for
<ul>
  <li>
    removal of all licensing issues associated with JBoss,
  </li>
  <li>
    simplified application deployment and administration,
  </li>
  <li>
    deployment to the most widely used application servers, and
  </li>
  <li>
    complex JEE modules have been replaced with simplified code using Spring.
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="NBIA6.4ReleaseAnnouncement-ImprovedQCWorkflowFlags">
  Improved QC Workflow Flags
</h2>
New flags have been added to the QC Tool to improve workflow. This includes:
<ul>
  <li>
    Configurable flag names
  </li>
  <li>
    Released flag
  </li>
  <li>
    Batch number that can be set via CTP
  </li>
  <li>
    Confirmed as complete
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="NBIA6.4ReleaseAnnouncement-IntegratedRESTAPI">
  Integrated REST API
</h2>
The search screens within NBIA have been updated to use an open API to perform their operations. This OAuth2-secured API can be used by application developers to create their own front ends for the NBIA business logic using any tool they choose.

<h2 id="NBIA6.4ReleaseAnnouncement-SortingforDownloadManager">
  Sorting for Download Manager
</h2>
Download Manager now sorts the series. This allow users to better distinguish which series have already been downloaded.

<h2 id="NBIA6.4ReleaseAnnouncement-caGridCodeCleanup">
  caGrid Code Cleanup
</h2>
All caGrid code and artifacts have been removed from NBIA. This cleanup simplifies the environment and lowers the learning curve for new developers.

<h2 id="NBIA6.4ReleaseAnnouncement-ManageSharedListAPI">
  Manage Shared List API
</h2>
A secure REST API for creating and deleting shared lists has been added. This allows the management of Shared Lists from other tools.
