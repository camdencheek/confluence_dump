            If the query is a saved query that has been edited since the last execution date, the name of the saved query is displayed with an asterisk. The asterisk refers to a message at the bottom of the page which is a warning to you that the results are based on the criteria that were used at the time the query was run, not the criteria that are currently saved for the query.
