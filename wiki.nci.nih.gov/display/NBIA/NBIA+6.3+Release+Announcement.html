  Improved DICOM Support
</h2>
The database adapter has been improved to allow the submission of additional DICOM objects:
<ul>
  <li>
    The adapter uses SOPClassUID to determine requirements so that secondary capture images that are of MR modality can be submitted.
  </li>
  <li>
    The adapter can successfully handle enhanced multi-framed MR images.
  </li>
</ul>

In order to help improve DICOM submission, CTP has been upgraded to the latest version.
