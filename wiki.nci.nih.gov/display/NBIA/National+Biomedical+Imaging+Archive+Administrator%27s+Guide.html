  Creating a New NBIA User
</h2>
Only an NBIA administrator can create new users for NBIA.Before NBIA users can be created, an administrator with access to the User Authorization Tool must register the NCIA application and assign an administrative user to the NCIA application there. The administrator can then assign users to NBIA and roles to each user. The following table describes the role structure in NBIA.

.When an image is uploaded to NBIA, it is not made public immediately. A curator takes it through a quality control process to ensure that no private patient data is available, the image is of good quality, and so forth. Using the QC tool as a curator, you can define search criteria to locate image series for you to evaluate. You can then evaluate the submission and assign the QC status to an image or image series.QC tool search visibilityThe QC tool allows a curator to search &#34;non-visible&#34; or &#34;not reviewed&#34; images, whereas a regular user using the search tool can only see approved public images.Topics in this section:

  Creating a New NBIA User
</a>
.A workflow is a business process that, in the case of NBIA, an image series must pass through before it is published. Since it is a business process, these steps must be defined first within an organization. NBIA allows you to change the visibility status of an image series. This visibility change is part of the definition of a workflow item. Workflow items can also trigger a web service call to a URL. When you define a workflow item, you specify a name for it, the type of action that will take place during it (such as a visibility change), which image collection and site are involved, and the URL of a web service if the information resulting from this workflow item should be sent to one.You can
