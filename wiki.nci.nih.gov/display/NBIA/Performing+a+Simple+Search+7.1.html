A simple search allows you to search for image studies based on a combination of the following search filters: Collections, Image Modality, Anatomical Site, Date released on TCIA, and Subject IDs. The more criteria you select, the fewer results you receive. After you select your search criteria, you can save your query to use later.To perform a simple search

The images include four-dimensional (4D) fan beam (4D-FBCT) and 4D cone beam CT (4D-CBCT). All patients underwent concurrent radiochemotherapy to a total dose of 64.8-70 Gy using daily 1.8 or 2 Gy fractions.  A single Radiation Oncologist delineated targets and organs at risk in all 4D-FBCT and a limited number of 4D-CBCT images.
