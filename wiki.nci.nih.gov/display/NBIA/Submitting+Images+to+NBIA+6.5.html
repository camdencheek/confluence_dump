  Image Submission Overview
</h2>
When you submit an image to NBIA using FileSender, the process follows the path illustrated in the following flowchart:
<img alt="FileSender, CTP Client Anonymizer, Internet, CTP Server, NBIA Database " src="https://wiki.nci.nih.gov/download/attachments/embedded-page/NBIA/Submitting%20Images%20to%20NBIA%206.5/path%20image%20submission75.png?api=v2">
 In summary, the process involves the following steps. These steps are described in detail in the succeeding sections of this user&#39;s guide.
<ol>
  <li>
    Before submitting data, a collection should be created in the
    <a href="https://wiki.nci.nih.gov/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=373005724" rel="nofollow">
      User Authorization Tool (UAT)
    </a>
    . Roles such as “READ” and “MANAGE_VISIBILITY_STATUS” can be assigned to users for a given collection in the UAT.
  </li>
  <li>
    Install the FileSender and the CTP (Clinical Trial Processor) client. The CTP is configured for the client (sender) and the server (receiver). This tool anonymizes the data as well as assigns collection information which is required for storage, search and security provisioning of the data.
  </li>
  <li>
    Unzip the file and open both tools on your local machine.
  </li>
  <li>
    In FileSender, locate the image(s) to be submitted.
  </li>
  <li>
    Update the anonymization script.
  </li>
  <li>
    FileSender sends the image(s) to the RSNA Clinical Trial Processor (CTP) client, which anonymizes the data to comply with patient privacy policies.
  </li>
  <li>
    The CTP client forwards the image(s) over the internet to the CTP server, which stores the file(s) in the database.
  </li>
  <li>
    The CTP server transfers the image(s) to your NBIA database repository.
  </li>
</ol>
The submission process can be monitored using the CTP client (to see how many images were sent), CTP server (to see how many images were received) and the
<a href="https://wiki.cancerimagingarchive.net/display/NBIA/TCIA+Current+Help+Topics#TCIACurrentHelpTopics-ViewingSubmissionReports" rel="nofollow">
  View Submission Reports
</a>
 tool within NBIA to ensure the images were successfully added to the database and file system. The
<a href="https://wiki.nci.nih.gov/display/NBIA/NBIA+Help+Topics#NBIAHelpTopics-ViewingSubmissionReports" rel="nofollow">
  View Submission Reports
</a>
 tool requires the “VIEW_SUBMISSION_REPORT” role in the UAT.Once receipt of the images is confirmed, users with the “MANAGE_VISIBILITY_STATUS” role can use the
<a href="https://wiki.nci.nih.gov/display/NBIA/NBIA+Help+Topics#NBIAHelpTopics-UsingtheQualityControlTool" rel="nofollow">
  QC Tool
</a>
 to review images, make them visible to users with read access to the collection, set them as invisible or mark them for deletion. In order for images to be deleted by a user with the “NCIA.SUPER_CURATOR” role must approve the images that are marked for deletion using the
<a href="https://wiki.nci.nih.gov/display/NBIA/NBIA+Help+Topics#NBIAHelpTopics-ApprovingImageDeletions" rel="nofollow">
  Approve Deletion
</a>
 tool within NBIA. Images that have been approved for deletion will be auto-deleted that night during off-peak hours to save system resources. This two-step process is designed to minimize accidental deletions. See also

  Installation of the CTP Client/Server
</h2>
To submit images, you must have the CTP client both installed and running on your machine. The installation of the CTP Client/Server is embedded into the NBIA application installation process.For example, the installation path for the CTP in Windows is:
<ul>
  <li>
    C:\apps\nbia\CTP-client
  </li>
  <li>
    C:\apps\nbia\CTP-client\FileSender
  </li>
  <li>
    C:\apps\nbia\CTP-server
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="SubmittingImagestoNBIA6.5-ConfiguringtheCTPClient">
  Configuring the CTP Client
</h3>
As noted above, to submit images, you must have the FileSender and the CTP client both installed and running on your machine. For information regarding your specific installation issues, contact
<a href="https://datascience.cancer.gov/about/application-support" rel="nofollow">
  NCI Application Support
</a>
.To configure the CTP client, perform the following steps:
<ol>
  <li>
    To start your local CTP client, execute the ctp.bat (ctp.sh in Linux) in the CTP-Client/CTP folder. In Windows, the file path is: C:\apps\nbia\CTP-client\CTP\ctp.bat.
  </li>
  <li>
    Open a browser and type in the CTP client URL for your local installation. You can find the port number by looking in the config.xml file in the CTP folder. The third line of the standard file is &#34;&lt;Server port=&#34;24080&#34; /&gt;&#34;. If changes are made to this number, the localhost port needed to access the CTP admin page changes in tandem.Example URL for CTP client:
    <a href="http://localhost:24080/" rel="nofollow">

  <li>
    Click the Configuration button. The Configuration page appears.
  </li>
  <li>
    Verify the URL in the bottom section of the page, HTTP Export. This should point to the import service of the CTP server to which the images will be exported from the CTP client. You cannot change the text on this page; it must be changed in the config.xml file referred to in step 2.
  </li>
  <li>
    Once the file(s) are received in the CTP client, they are anonymized there. To configure the anonymization parameters, you must be logged in. Request the login credentials from your administrator.

  Anonymizing DICOM Images
</h3>
The default configuration for submitting images to NBIA is detailed in the da.script file. You can override that script by customizing anonymization parameters on the DICOM Anonymizer Configurator page, which follows. This page indicates how the image&#39;s DICOM tags are modified to anonymize the data, thus meeting HIPAA regulations to preserve patients&#39; privacy. For example, the patient&#39;s birth date and patient ID are anonymized.
<img alt="DICOM Anonymizer Configurator page from the CTP client. See text." width="500" src="https://wiki.nci.nih.gov/download/attachments/embedded-page/NBIA/Submitting%20Images%20to%20NBIA%206.5/DICOM%20anonymizer%20configurator80.png?api=v2">
The following fields on this page are required:
<ul>
  <li>
    PROJECT NAME--This must correspond to whatever you are going to call the collection. The name might indicate the type of data, the research center that provided the data, or the collection type such as CT colonography for CT images of colonography.
  </li>
  <li>
    TRIAL NAME – This must be the same as the project name.
  </li>
  <li>
    SITE NAME – This identifies where data is coming from. Example = BioU. Several different collections could be submitted from there, but all would have same site name. The NBIA user does not see the source site for the data, except when using the Verify Submission feature, described in

    </a>
    .Authorization controlsAuthorization controls pay attention to the site. So a user, based on permissions, for example, may be able to search on collection X//site A, but not collection X//site B.
  </li>
  <li>
    SITE ID – This is a predetermined, unique ID that always maps to the specific site. This is always constant for a given site and must be used when you submit images to your image repository. Example: BioU = 17. The four values above are required; without them, the submission will fail.
  </li>
</ul>
The following field can also be configured.
<ul>
  <li>
    UID ROOT – This ID, assigned by an NBIA administrator, remains unique for every submitted collection from a particular research center. The anonymizer uses the identifier, typically a prefix for series instance UIDs, to determine the values for DICOM tags.  If you are submitting only to your local isolated system, you, as an administrator, can determine the UID root yourself.
  </li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>
    If a true globally unique ID Root is obtained, the UID Root will need to be appended by a UID Root End for each collection/site combination that will be submitted to that node of NBIA. This will keep the UIDs truly unique. For example:
  </li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>
    <ul>
      <li>
        UID Root = 555
      </li>

        Collection A, Site 2 UID Root End = .2
      </li>
      <li>
        Collection B, Site 1 UID Root End = .3
      </li>
      <li>
        Collection B, Site 2 UID Root End = .4
      </li>
      <li>
        Collection A, Site 1 UID Root = 555.1
      </li>
      <li>
        Collection A, Site 2 UID Root = 555.2
      </li>
      <li>
        Collection B, Site 1 UID Root = 555.3
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>

  Troubleshooting Unsuccessful Image Submission

    If you suspect your files have not been submitted successfully to the CTP client, click the Quarantines button in the CTP client main page to see if any files have been received there. If no files are quarantined, the quarantine indicators remain at zero.QuarantinesEach stage of processing in CTP can cause a quarantine, therefore, the quarantine count is broken down by stage.

    To see the list of quarantined files per stage, click the corresponding hyperlink for that stage.

      <li>
        If something is quarantined in the Import stage, the file is likely not a DICOM file.
      </li>
      <li>
        If something is quarantined in the Anonymizer stage, there is likely an error in the anonymization script. Common problems with the anonymization script are:
        <ul>
          <li>
            incorrect syntax (See the

    If the quarantine feature indicates a file has been sent there, click the corresponding hypertext link. You will be able to view one link to the DICOM header file of the quarantined file.

    Click the Log button on the CTP client main page.

  <li>
    Click the hypertext link to review the activity of the CTP client. This may help you determine the cause of an unsuccessful submission.

    The same troubleshooting rules apply for CTP server, but the stages are different.
    <ul>
      <li>
        If a quarantine occurs in the storage service, a likely cause is that there is not enough disk space or the drive is not accessible by CTP.
      </li>
      <li>
        If a quarantine occurs in the export service, there is likely something more subtle &#34;wrong&#34; with the DICOM file that NBIA doesn&#39;t like. For example, submitting an image that has the same series instance UID as a different, previously submitted image could cause a quarantine here. Looking in the log may reveal the issue.

  Alternative Image Configuration/Submission Methods
</h2>
You can use several other alternative methods for configuring and submitting images to the CTP client and/or servers. An example is the PACS radiology machine which takes DICOM images and sends them directly to a CTP server, circumventing the need to send the images and accompanying patient information over the internet. For more information about using these alternative submission methods, contact
