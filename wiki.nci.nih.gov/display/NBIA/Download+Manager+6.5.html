The most convenient method of downloading NBIA data is by using the Downloader. You must install the Downloader before you begin downloading data.However, if you cannot download the application, the alternative is to use the Temporary Downloader, a Java Network Launch Protocol (JNLP) file previously called the NBIA Download Manager.The Temporary Downloader allows you to replicate items in your Data Basket, downloading them to your local machine.  It is a Java program and requires that you install a Java Runtime Environment (JRETM) on your machine to run it. You can

The Temporary Downloader does not limit the total size of the download.JREYou must have version 8 or higher of the Java Runtime Environment (JRE) installed to be able to open the Download Manager.

  <li>
    If JRE 8 is installed, the Temporary Downloader attempts to start. To run the application, you must click Run in the Warning dialog box indicating the application&#39;s digital signature cannot be verified. Before doing so, you can select the More Information... link at the bottom of the dialog to view a more detailed report of any security issues. Then you can evaluate whether you want to run the application.
  </li>
  <li>
    If JRE is installed but the version is older than version 6, the browser automatically attempts to upgrade the JRE to version 8.
  </li>
  <li>
    If the JRE is not installed, when you click the Download Manager button, the browser prompts you for what it should do with the JNLP file. The My Data Basket page includes a link to a page where you can download
