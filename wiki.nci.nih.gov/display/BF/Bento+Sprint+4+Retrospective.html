    List anything that we could have done better in this sprint (add your name after your comment)
  </li>
  <li>
    We need to improve in keeping tickets up to date to make sure everything is tracked accurately. There were two instances where decisions about work were made during meetings but we failed to update the tickets resulting in tickets incorrectly being marked as ready for testing or requirements being miscommunicated - Austin
  </li>
  <li>
    While creating a ticket to update the environment variables I forgot to include the Bento-local section. In the future, to update any environment variable Bento-local also will be included(

    Testing scope must be defined for any task (EX: Extra filters/YAML query) related tickets before testing. -Sofia
