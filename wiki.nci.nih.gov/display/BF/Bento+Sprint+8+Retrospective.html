    I think our collaboration was especially good in this sprint. Everything seemed to go smoothly when it involved multiple team members working together to complete tickets. (

    Communication with the team in regards to issues could be improved and we can be more proactive in taking steps to resolve them sooner(

    FE Refactor planning can be better. Only recently, we found some things that need to be moved/cleaned up. Luckily those are not big ticket items. We&#39;ll try to do better next time. (

    I relearned to not take error messages at it&#39;s face value. There was an React error blocked me for a while, until

      Rana, Ambar (NIH/NCI) [C]
