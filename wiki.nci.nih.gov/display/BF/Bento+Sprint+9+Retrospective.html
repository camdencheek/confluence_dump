    Very nice effort on the documentation by all Bento engineers. I think this will greatly help future users of the Bento Framework. (

    Several people weighed in with their opinions and reasoning for InputMinMax&#39;s behavior. Good comms and clear direction from

    There looks to be a discrepancy with the &#34;Add All&#34; button on the Explore Dashboard. I would expect this function to respect the facet filters selected by the user, such that &#34;All&#34; files only pertains to files in the Dashboard table, but that is not the case. We may need to revisit the original requirements. (

    Apologies for the delayed documentation tickets; they were put on hold due to other priorities. To prevent this from happening in the future, I recognize the need to define clear priorities and ensure timely delivery of work. During the planning phase, I underestimated the priority of tasks like Bento Local, which led to some delays. It&#39;s on me and work on improving our process by setting clear expectations beforehand. Let&#39;s learn from this experience and strive for better coordination and prioritization moving forward. (

    Clarification on phrases like &#34;Don&#39;t allow &lt;user action&gt;&#34; - some actions cannot be prevented, so what precisely should be done in response to the action? (
