(TBD: I need help adding 4 new rows to the following tables, one for each of the new registration statuses: Historical, Incomplete, Preferred Standard, &amp; Recorded. Denise said the following tables might not be needed in this caDSR II page, but check with Brenda.)The following registration statuses are assigned to administered items used across all NCI contexts.

        An Administered Item has met all quality requirements, and is ready to be reviewed for usage in all contexts. The Context Administrators have confirmed that the mandatory metadata attributes are complete and conform to applicable quality requirements. An Administered Item can be assigned a &#34;Qualified&#34; Registration Status when it reaches one of the Workflow Statuses listed. It will be reviewed to determine if it represents an information concept of interest across contexts.
        <ul>
          <li>
            If the context administrators determine the Administered Item should become a candidate for standardization, it can be promoted to a Registration Status of &#34;Proposed.&#34;
          </li>
          <li>
            If the Context Administrators determine that the Administered Item is not a candidate for standardization, a Registration Status of &#34;Suspended&#34; will be assigned.
          </li>
        </ul>
        (TBD: I need help updating these 2 bullet points because &#34;Proposed&#34; and &#34;Suspended&#34; are no longer listed in GUI. Denise said this table might not be needed in this caDSR II page, but check with Brenda.)
