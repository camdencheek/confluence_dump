When you search for conceptual domains in OneData, keep in mind the following points:
<ul>
  <li>
    Searches are not case sensitive. Searches for Gene and gene return the same results.
  </li>
  <li>
    In any editable text field, enter a search string, complete or partial. This does not apply to numeric fields such as Public ID.
  </li>
  <li>
    In any editable text field, you can use a percent sign (%) as a wildcard. For examples, refer to

    .
  </li>
  <li>
    The system processes search criteria as AND statements, so the results include only conceptual domains that fulfill all the criteria.
  </li>
  <li>
    You can specify the number of results returned: Type a number in the Number of Rows field and press &lt;Enter&gt;.
  </li>
  <li>
    When you remove or change search criteria, the system does not update search results until you clickÂ Apply Filter again.
