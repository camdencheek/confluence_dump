Starting in 2016 NCI caDSR team began participating in the NIH CDE Task Force (TF).  Subsequently a small group was formed to develop a recommendation for an NIH-wide CDE infrastructure.  The recommendation, the NIH Master Reference Dictionary Proposal,  was developed by a small group within the CDE TF, led by Matthew McAulffie - NIH Center for Information Technology (CIT) and including members from 9 institutes and National Library of Medicine (NLM), from 2017 to August of 2018 when the proposal was delivered to NIH Scientific Data Council (SDC).The 9 Institutes involved in MDR Proposal development:
<ul>
  <li>
    NIH Center for Information Technology (CIT)
  </li>
  <li>
    National Cancer Institute (NCI)
  </li>
  <li>
    National Eye Institute (NEI)
  </li>
  <li>
    National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI)
  </li>
  <li>
    National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI)
  </li>
  <li>
    National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering (NIBIB)
  </li>
  <li>
    National Institutes on Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK)
  </li>
  <li>
    National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH)
  </li>
  <li>
    National Institute on Minority Health and Health Disparities (NIMHD)
  </li>
  <li>
    National Institute of Nursing Research (NINR)
  </li>
</ul>
The proposal was for an evolving infrastructure to leverage the institutes existing CDE infrastructure and expand capabilities for interoperability with the NIH CDE Repository.  The proposal also recommended establishment of a governance process to harmonize CDEs across the institutes where appropriate. Subsequently, the NLM made a recommendation that the NIH adopt FHIR Structures for CDEs, suggesting that the FHIR Observation could be used for 90% of the NIH CDEs.
