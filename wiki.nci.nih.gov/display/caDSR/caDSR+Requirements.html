  caDSR Requirements Gathering Process
</h3>
caDSR is part of the NCI Semantic Infrastructure and current plans are to refresh and extend the infrastructure to align with broader initiatives, while preserving and improving current capabilities.  The requirements for caDSR stakeholders has been changing and expanding over the past 5-6 years, however largely, we&#39;ve addressed technology stack, security, and 508 compliance during that time.  In 2014, a decision was taken to rebuild and modernize these services and make it easier to discover the consensus standards and integrate these elements and linked data into cancer research and care workflows. In addition, we have a goal to harmonize our capabilities with broader metadata initiatives nationally and internationally, such as with NLM, ONC SDC CDISC, FDA, AHRQ, and HL7 FHIR.caDSR tooling requirements arise in many settings. By using one of the means described below you will ensure that your ideas have been successfully communicated and documented. Software requests for enhancements are acknowledged by the caDSR team with the creation of an item in our tracking database and assigned a reference number, making it easy to track your favorite request! If it doesn&#39;t have a GForge tracker number, we haven&#39;t yet realized it as a requirement.Requirements have come from the following sources, some of which are no longer valid, but many of which represent continued areas of need:

As the release cycle progresses we begin a public review and prioritization, drawing from variety of factors to make final &#34;in/out&#34; decisions. We conduct user feedback sessions throughout the design and prototype phases.

  caDSR Futures

NCI is planning to modernize the decade-plus old caDSR semantic metadata infrastructure and tools to simplify, streamline, and make it easier to integrate into research and health care processes and systems, and better support community comment, curation, and harmonization of content and data.  While the requirements process has been ongoing, documenting what we have been hearing began last fall, and we are already collaborating and aligning with sister NIH ICs, as well as with other national and international metadata initiatives.  We recently decided it would be very useful to seek broad community input via an RFI (
<a href="https://grants.nih.gov/grants/guide/notice-files/NOT-CA-15-019.html" rel="nofollow">
  NOT-CA-15-019
</a>
).  Please see CHILD PAGES below for links to the RFI document and the requirements draft, which will be updated as it evolves with community input.
