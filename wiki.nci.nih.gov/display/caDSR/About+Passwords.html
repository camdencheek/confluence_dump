The caDSR II password rules follow NIH guidelines. These guidelines suggest each user create a passphrase, which is more secure. When changing or resetting your caDSR II user account, keep in mind the following password rules:
<ul>
  <li>
    Specify at least 15 characters. There is no maximum.
  </li>
  <li>
    Specify a different password than your previous ten passwords.
  </li>
  <li>
    Passwords are case-sensitive. That is, password is not the same as PASSWORD.
  </li>
  <li>
    Passwords expire in 365 days.
  </li>
</ul>
