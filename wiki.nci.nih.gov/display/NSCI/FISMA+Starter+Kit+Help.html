All new information systems require that the following forms be completed to establish an information system&#39;s security-impact rating, authentication requirements, privacy implications, and mission criticality:
<ul>
  <li>
    FIPS-199 System Security Impact Categorization (FIPS-199)
  </li>
  <li>
    E-Authentication Risk Assessment (E-Auth)
  </li>
  <li>
    Privacy Impact Assessment (PIA)
  </li>
  <li>
    Business Impact Analysis (BIA)
  </li>
</ul>
We refer to these forms collectively as the &#34;security starter kit&#34; because they need to be completed before any other security compliance work begins. The information needed for these forms also helps define a system’s security and privacy requirements.  The starter kit is a precursor to the formal FISMA authorization that is required prior to a system going live.The information below will help you complete the starter kit.
