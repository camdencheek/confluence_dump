Welcome to the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Contractor-focused Information Technology and Security Website. These pages were designed to guide the NCI contractor and grantee communities on information security and compliance related matters.  Under the Chief Information Officer (CIO), the NCI Enterprise Security Program (ESP) is providing these resources to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of NCI information and information systems.The security information provided is intended to inform the user community about IT policies, requirements and guidance as well as address the most commonly asked IT security questions. These questions are addressed through current guidance, policies, templates, security links of interest, and assessment and authorization (A&amp;A) guidance. We update this information as needed to provide the latest resources you might need to better understand and meet the variety of IT security rules we must comply with as a Federal agency. However, if you cannot find the security information you are looking for, please do not hesitate to email the security office at
