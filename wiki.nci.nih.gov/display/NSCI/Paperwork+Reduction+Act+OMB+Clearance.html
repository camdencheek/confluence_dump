The law applies to data collections by Federal agencies and by federally sponsored 3rd parties, to voluntary and mandatory collections, and to all collection formats including but not limited to electronic, telephonic, paper, and oral.For PRA purposes, the definition of “public” also includes federal contractors and training fellows.
