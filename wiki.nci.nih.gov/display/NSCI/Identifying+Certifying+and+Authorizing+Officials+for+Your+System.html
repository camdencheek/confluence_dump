The Certifying Agent (CA) is typically the designated system security officer for the associated system or may be an independent security contractor who conducted the assessment. The Authorizing Official (AO) must be a Federal official with the proper authority and oversight for the system. By signing the Authorization to Operate (ATO) letter, the AO not only accepts the results of the assessment and certifies compliance with the FISMA, but he or she also formally accepts any residual risks that have been identified and commits to provide the necessary resources to address those that will be fixed. The following table provides the recommended certifying agent and authorizing officials based on where each system is housed and operated.
