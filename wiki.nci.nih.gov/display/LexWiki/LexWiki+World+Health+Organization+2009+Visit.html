Friday, May 15, 2009
Mayo Clinic, Stabile Building

Visitor:
Robert Jakob, MD is Medical Officer of World Health Organization (WHO) in charge of the the International Classification of Diseases (ICD) and derived classifications, since 2005. Dr. Jakob led a team that helped formulate a German emergency data set, and other data sets for the German electronic health card, as well as creating a registry for &#34;electronic objects&#34; (OID) in health. He was earlier in charge of ICD use in mortality statistics, the ICD adaptation for Oncology, the ICF (International Classification of Functioning, Disability, and Health), and consulting for the classification of procedures in medicine. Dr. Jakob is a member of the German Society of Medical Informatics, Biometry and Epidemiology, has a diploma in medical quality management (German Medical Board) and Management of Health and Social Institutions (Univ. Kaiserslautern). He is a board certified surgeon and received his medical education at the University of Essen.

Dr. Jakob visited the Mayo Clinic to discuss the LexWiki platform for the intranet based ICD11 Revision in addition to demos on LexGrid tools. The WHO has launched a major online project to revise the global standard for medical and health statistics - the ICD. Previous ICD revisions were based on annual revision conferences attended by a limited number of selected experts. This internet-based revision process provides wider scientific input, greater transparency and better exchange with the wide range of users, making the final ICD revision more useful.
