  Known Issues and workarounds

    LexWiki Publisher 2.0 does not post generated pages directly to the wiki. An extension to LexWiki Publisher can easily be added to enable that. You will need a third party tool like Media Bot or similar to make the process easier.
  </li>
  <li>
    LexWiki Publisher 2.0 does not define wiki property and association pages for their types.
  </li>
</ul>
