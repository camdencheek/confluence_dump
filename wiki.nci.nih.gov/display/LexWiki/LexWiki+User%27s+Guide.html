  Scope
</h2>
This document is intended for terminology content authors. It provides an overview of the browsing and authoring features that LexWiki supports.
<h2 id="LexWikiUser&#39;sGuide-Prerequisites">
  Prerequisites
</h2>
LexWiki is a Web-based application. You will need a web browser and the address (URL) of your LexWiki application. You will also need an account (username and password).
<h2 id="LexWikiUser&#39;sGuide-Authenticating">
  Authenticating

  Browsing
</h2>
This page explains ways to browse and search for terminology on the LexWiki.
<h3 id="LexWikiUser&#39;sGuide-BrowsingConcepts">
  Browsing Concepts
</h3>
Concepts are called _categories_ on the wiki pages.For the sake of familiarity, the help pages use concept.

The LexWiki installer automatically loads a sub set of the BiomedGT terminology. When you view a newly installed LexWiki, you should see the following on the main page.
<img src="https://wiki.nci.nih.gov/download/attachments/embedded-page/LexWiki/LexWiki%20User&#39;s%20Guide/SamplePages.jpg?api=v2">
This is the terminology Tree View. You can drill down to more specific concepts by clicking the plus sign [+] which precedes to each concept.

A concept with a name preceded by a bracketed period [.] has no child concepts.Once you select a concept, the wiki displays a detail page for that concept. For more information about the detail page, see

<h3 id="LexWikiUser&#39;sGuide-SearchingforConcepts">
  Searching for Concepts
</h3>
Concepts are called _categories_ on the wiki pages.For the sake of familiarity, the help pages use concept.

The most efficient way to search is to use the search box at the top of the left navigation bar. The following topics explain how to set your search preferences, perform a simple search, and use the Autocomplete feature.
<h4 id="LexWikiUser&#39;sGuide-AbouttheGoButtonandSearchButton">
  About the Go Button and Search Button
</h4>
Below the search box, you will find two buttons: Go and Search.
<ul>
  <li>
    Click the Go button when you know that a category (concept) page exists and you know the exact name of the page. For example, if the full page name is Category:BGT Cytoskeletal Gene(B20918), type the full page name in the search box and click Go. Although this works best when you provide the exact page name, even entering an inexact name displays a results list with possible matches.
  </li>
  <li>
    Click the Search button for general searches where you enter a search term or use
    <a href="https://wiki.nci.nih.gov/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=63242271" rel="nofollow">
      autocomplete
    </a>
    . This displays a search results page.
  </li>
</ul>
<h4 id="LexWikiUser&#39;sGuide-SettingYourSearchPreferences">
  Setting Your Search Preferences
</h4>
You need to be
<a href="https://wiki.nci.nih.gov/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=63242271" rel="nofollow">

</a>
to perform this task.

You can set search preferences to control how your results are displayed and which namespaces you use for searching. To set preferences, follow these steps:
<ol>
  <li>
    Log in to LexWiki.
  </li>
  <li>
    Click the my preferences link in the the top right of the page.
    Your user profile page appears.
  </li>
  <li>
    Click the Search tab.
  </li>
  <li>
    Set your results display preferences by typing values in the three text boxes: Hits per page, Lines per hit, and Context per line.
  </li>
  <li>
    Select namespaces for searching by selecting the appropriate boxes.
    We recommend checking at least Category, Relation, and Property. You may also want to add Proposal  and Proposal Talk.
  </li>
  <li>
    Click the Save button.
    A message confirms that your preferences have been saved.
  </li>
</ol>
<h4 id="LexWikiUser&#39;sGuide-UsingaSimpleSearchTerm">
  Using a Simple Search Term
</h4>
You perform a simple search when you simply enter a search term or phrase and run the search. To search using a term or phrase, follow these steps:
<ol>
  <li>
    Click in the search box at the top of the left navigation bar.
  </li>
  <li>
    Type a search term or phrase.
  </li>
  <li>
    Click the Search button.
    The wiki displays a Search Results page.
  </li>
  <li>
    To view details for a concept:
    <ul>
      <li>
        Click the concept name, or
      </li>
      <li>
        Click the plus sign [+] preceding the concept name to drill down to child concepts.
        A category with a name preceded by a bracketed period . has no child concepts.}Once you select a concept, the wiki displays a detail page for that concept. For more information about the detail page, see
        <a href="https://wiki.nci.nih.gov/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=63242271" rel="nofollow">

        .
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>
<h4 id="LexWikiUser&#39;sGuide-AboutAutocomplete">
  About Autocomplete
</h4>
The Autocomplete feature enhances your searches by providing a list of suggested terms, based on what you type. To activate Autocomplete while entering search text, type some text and then press Ctrl + Spacebar (on Mac, this is Ctrl + Alt + Spacebar). When Autocomplete is active and working, you will see a red swirling circle while entering a search term.

If you want to use Autocomplete without pressing Ctrl + Spacebar, you can turn on an auto-triggered setting as described in steps 5 and 6 of
<a href="https://wiki.nci.nih.gov/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=63242271" rel="nofollow">
  #Setting Up Autocomplete
</a>
.

Autocomplete recognizes namespaces for the available terminologies on the wiki. If you type a string without a namespace prefix, such as bed followed by Ctrl + Spacebar, the returned list displays concepts (categories) with a BGT prefix.

To restrict search results to a specific namespace, add the namespace prefix to your search text. For example, if you want to find a Semantic Type from the STY namespace such as the STY Cell concept (category), you would type the following:

STY followed by Ctrl + Spacebar

or

STY Ce followed by Ctrl+ Spacebar
<h4 id="LexWikiUser&#39;sGuide-SettingUpAutocomplete">
  Setting Up Autocomplete
</h4>
You need to be
<a href="https://wiki.nci.nih.gov/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=63242271" rel="nofollow">
  VKC:authenticated
</a>
to perform this task.

Autocomplete is set up by default. As explained in
<a href="https://wiki.nci.nih.gov/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=63242271" rel="nofollow">
  #About Autocomplete
</a>
, you can use this feature by pressing Ctrl + Spacebar while searching. If Autocomplete doesn&#39;t appear to be working, or if you would rather not press this keystroke during search, you can enable the Auto-triggered auto-completion setting in the following procedure.

Note that you may sometimes get faster results by using a simple search. For example, if you type lung (instead of lung as part of a phrase), then simple search might be the better choice.

To verify and/or change Autocomplete settings, follow these steps:
<ol>
  <li>
    Log in to LexWiki.
  </li>
  <li>
    Click the my preferences link in the the top right of the page.
    Your user profile page appears.
  </li>
  <li>
    Click the Skin tab.
  </li>
  <li>
    Select the OntoLiteSkin option if it is not already selected.
  </li>
  <li>
    To enable Autocomplete without requiring a keystroke, do the following:
    <ol>
      <li>
        Click the Misc tab.
      </li>
      <li>
        Check the Auto-triggered auto-completion box.
        If you select this setting, you don&#39;t need to press Ctrl + Spacebar to use Autocomplete. You can tell that this setting is enabled if you have not pressed the keystroke and a red swirling circle appears while you are entering a search term.
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>
    Click the Save button.
    A message confirms that your preferences have been saved.
  </li>
</ol>
<h4 id="LexWikiUser&#39;sGuide-UsingAutocomplete">
  Using Autocomplete
</h4>
To search using Autocomplete, follow these steps:
<ol>
  <li>
    Click in the search box at the top of the left navigation bar.
  </li>
  <li>
    Type one or two characters.
    <ul>
      <li>
        If Autocomplete is set to work automatically, you will see a red swirling circle while entering the term.
      </li>
      <li>
        If you do not see the red swirling circle, press Ctrl + Spacebar. To enable automatic use of Autocomplete, you need to change your settings as explained in

        Select a term from the list to add it to the search box; or
      </li>
      <li>
        Type additional characters to change the results appearing in the list.
        All BiomedGT concepts start with the letters BGT before the name, so type something such as *BGT Activ* to find _BGT Activity_  or other variations.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    Do either of the following:
    <ul>
      <li>

<h4 id="LexWikiUser&#39;sGuide-ExaminingConceptDetails">
  Examining Concept Details
</h4>
When you select a concept from a search results list, the wiki displays a detail page for that concept. The page name has the concept name and code (for example, Category: BGT Beckers Nevus(B4097) or Category:CTCAE Allergy/Immunology) and includes links to other concepts.

If the page name includes v1 in the title, a collaborator has submitted a proposal to modify the represented concept in some way.}If this is the case, concept details that are affected by the proposal are shown in red, bold text.

Each detail page includes the information described in the following table.

If you are authenticated, you can propose changes or additions to the terminology that LexWiki is hosting. For example, you might suggest changes to such information as preferred names, definitions, synonyms, associations, and parents. You can do this through either a

<h3 id="LexWikiUser&#39;sGuide-AboutStructuredProposals">
  About Structured Proposals
</h3>
The more formal method of proposing changes and additions is through the submission of a structured proposal. This type of proposal requires that you complete a standardized submission form. You can save and edit the proposal using the same structured form. For more information, see

<h3 id="LexWikiUser&#39;sGuide-AboutUnstructuredProposals">
  About Unstructured Proposals
</h3>
Before proposing changes, a group of collaborators can start a discussion about the nature of the changes using a discussion page. They can also use this page to make recommendations to curators who may be integrating content from another terminology. A discussion page enables each contributor to add signed, date-stamped comments.

Examples of discussion page content:
<ul>
  <li>
    &#34;You should consider creating the sibling concepts for this concept because we need them in order to...&#34;
  </li>
  <li>
    &#34;We recommend adding a new property X for this concept and all its children to represent Y (give definition and other relevant info).&#34;
  </li>
</ul>
Be as specific as possible in your unstructured comments and recommendations.

When you are ready to submit a proposal for consideration, you can submit it as a package. The package can contain only one proposal or several proposals. Once you have submitted a proposal package, your package enters into a workflow process. The process has various stages, each with a status designation that identifies what process stage the package has reached:

If you are a registered user, you may click &#34;My workflow&#34; at the top of the page where you may browse and define &#34;MyWorkflow&#34; and browse &#34;My Proposals&#34;. Collaborators can propose changes to an existing concepts or propose new child concepts. A logical grouping of the various proposals from a particular collaborator forms part of his/her workflow package. This can be submitted for curation en masse for curation to be incorporated into the existing ontological model. The status for the individual packages tracks the changes to the workflow status. The user can log in to Lexwiki at any point of time and be informed of the status of the workflow by clicking on the &#34;My workflow&#34; link  at the top of the page. Post-curation, the workflow status can be set to one of Completed or Completed w/issues. The individual proposals can then be browsed to check whether they were accepted or rejected. For proposals that are accepted the wiki concept is updated or created accordingly.

To create a workflow package, follow these steps:
<ol>
  <li>
    Click on the &#34;My workflow&#34; tab at the top of the page.
  </li>
  <li>
    In the My Workflow Packages section, enter a name for the workflow package and click the Define Workflow Package button.
