The ATB allows you to generate a set of well-defined questions and answer choices to facilitate collecting information for a particular purpose, such as The Cancer Genome Atlas Glioblastoma (TCGA GBM) study. These questions and answers are contained in an AIM XML template file that you can import into an AIM-enabled application, such as NCI&#39;s implementation of AIM on the ClearCanvas open source workstation. Aided by the information in the XML file, users of the AIM-enabled application can then annotate medical images using a controlled vocabulary and standard template. This results in simple and constrained annotations that are reproducible and consistent. The AIM-enabled application captures answers and exports them as an AIM XML document or AIM Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine (DICOM) Structured Reporting (SR) document. Users can then send the document to the AIM Data Service or DICOM storage Service Class Provider (SCP), respectively.You use the ATB to design templates based on lexicons of standard and user-definable terms. You add anatomic entities, imaging observations, inferences, calculations, and markups as components to a template. Adding tags to a template helps you make them easier to find. You combine multiple templates into template groups.You can search for shared templates and template groups using the AIM Template Service and then modify them in the ATB.AIM templates are based on the AIM template XML schema: Version 2, Revision 13When you open older AIM templates created using XML schema version 1, revisions 18, 19, and 23 in ATB 2.0, ATB 2.0 automatically converts them to the latest XML schema, which is version 2, revision 13.AIM template XML schemas are based on the

and the AIM 4.0 model. XML schema version 2 collects more information than the AIM 3.0 model can store. Any information that the XML schema version 2 collects is saved to the AIM 4.0 model.Â
