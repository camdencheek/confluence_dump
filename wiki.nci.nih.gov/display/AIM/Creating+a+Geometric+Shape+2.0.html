Geometric shapes, which are equivalent to markups, describe a user&#39;s region of interest on an image and are patterned after DICOM SR graphical types. Combinations of these shapes can be used to represent graphical drawings placed on images.

  <li>
    Click the Templates tab.
  </li>
  <li>
    In the Templates panel, select the template to which you want to add a geometric shape.
  </li>
  <li>
    In the Template Components panel, right-click the template name and select Create Geometric Shape. You can also find this option in the toolbar (
    <img alt="Create a geometric shape button" src="https://wiki.nci.nih.gov/download/attachments/embedded-page/AIM/AIM%20Template%20Builder%201.1%20User&#39;s%20Guide/CreateGeometricShapeButton.png?api=v2">
    ). A new panel appears on the right and the toolbar below the Template Components panel changes to provide the option for geometric shapes.
  </li>
  <li>
    In the panel on the right, provide the required information, as follows:
    <ol>
      <li>
        Provide a Label for the calculation.
      </li>
      <li>
        Provide Explanatory Text to better describe the label.
      </li>
      <li>
        Specify the minimum and maximum number of Answer Choices that the person answering the related question may select in the template. Answer Choices inform the AIM template user how many markups the user has to create. For example, if there are two circles (min=max=2), the user should create two circles. If a multipoint is assigned with a value min=max=2, ATB interprets that this is a line (with two points, x1,y1 and x2,y2). Developers of an AIM-enabled workstation must know how to map AIM template markup to an appropriate graphical drawing tool on their workstation.
