You must have a caGrid account to publish an AIM template to the ATS.Registration is required for users who do not already have an account with a caGrid identity provider such as Dorian or the NCI Authentication Service. When you register, you create an account with the caGrid identity provider you are using, which is usually Dorian.If you already have an account with a caGrid identity provider such as Dorian or the NCI Authentication Service, you do not need to register. You can just log in with the account information you use for that identity provider.
