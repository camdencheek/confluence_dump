  Introduction
</h1>
The Annotation and Image Markup (AIM) project defines an information model and software tools to capture and create image annotations and markups using well-defined common data elements and controlled terminologies. The current release of the AIM version 3.0 model includes the AIM Toolkit. An implementation of the model exists on the

.The AIM Template Builder (ATB), along with an XML schema, facilitates creating AIM annotations. The open-source ATB assists clinicians, image researchers, or clinical trial study designers in creating a set of controlled questions and related answers to each question for a particular type of imaging study, without requiring knowledge of the AIM information model. A study’s image interpreters can make simple and constrained annotations in a structured format based on AIM templates.ATB creates XML documents that can be imported to the AIM workstation 3.0.4 or into an AIM-enabled application. Each question and answer is captured using a standardized vocabulary such as RadLex and SNOMED CT® or user-definable terms. ATB allows a user to create and store AIM templates on the user’s local computer. The ATB user interface allows a template owner to edit, rename, and delete a template or its contents. It automatically validates saved templates against the AIM template schema to ensure that the captured information matches the information that the AIM model requires.The AIM model enhances interoperability and information exchange between imaging and health information systems. Annotations stored in a computable model such as AIM can be queried not only to find images containing similar image content but also to correlate human or machine image observations with other biomedical data.Download the ATB from the

  Features in the 2.0 Release
</h2>
The Annotation and Image Markup (AIM) information model version 4.0 has several new significant capabilities, as described in the AIM 4.0 release notes. AIM Template Builder (ATB) 2.0 offers new features that allow investigators to design templates to collect additional information specified by the AIM 4.0 model. Other ATB 2.0 capabilities are based on user feedback.
<ul>

    Ability to skip a set of consecutive questions based on selected answer choice(s)
  </li>
  <li>
    Ability to assign default answer(s) to a question and characteristic quantification

  <li>
    Fewer steps to create anatomic entity, imaging observation, inference, calculation, and geometric shape components
  </li>
