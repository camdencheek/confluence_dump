A lexicon organizes the vocabulary that may appear in an AIM template. When you build a template, you can select terms from a lexicon that users of the template will be able to select as answers to template questions. For example, if an AIM template imported into an appropriate application prompts the user to specify the location of a lesion&#39;s geographic center, the template could restrict answers to certain allowed terms from the lexicon.You must first create a lexicon, then add lexicon entries to it. Those lexicon entries become the allowed terms that you add to a template.The ATB contains preselected terms from RadLex, caDSR (cancer Data Standards Registry and Repository) designed for a particular imaging study such as LIDC (Lung Image Database Consortium), and VASARI (Visually Accessible Rembrandt Images) vocabularies.
