  Introduction
</h2>
The Annotation and Image Markup (AIM) project includes an information model (the AIM model) and software tools to capture and create image annotations and markups using well-defined common data elements and controlled terminologies. The AIM model enhances interoperability and information exchange between imaging and health information systems.It captures the descriptive information for an image with user-generated graphical symbols placed on the image into a single common information source.  You can query AIM annotations to find images containing similar image content and correlate human image observations with other biomedical data.Downloads are listed on the

.The AIM Toolkit consists of the AIM C++ software library and a program called ANIVATR. The ANIVATR software application validates AIM annotations and transcodes them between AIM XML documents and AIM DICOM SR objects. ANIVATR does not have a capability to convert any XML documents or DICOM SR objects to AIM XML documents and AIM DICOM SR objects.

This release makes AIM Toolkit 4.1 a cross-platform set of tools. New CMake support enables developers on Windows, Linux, and OS X operating systems to create native executable components. By supporting all three major operating systems, generating and using AIM data becomes universally available. The AIM Toolkit provides the AIM Library 4.1 for incorporating AIM model and data into third-party applications, and the AIM converter tool ANIVATR for direct manipulation of AIM documents in AIM 4.0 XML and AIM 4.0 DICOM SR formats.The following issues were fixed. Links open the issue in NCI Tracker.

  Features in the AIM 4.0 Toolkit
</h2>
The Annotation and Image Markup (AIM) information model version 4.0 has evolved in response to the feedback and changing requirements from the imaging community. The model has become more flexible and expressive. It defines AIM statements that describe a finding found on an image or series of images. These statements represent a relationship between the subject and object entities in the AIM foundation model. A class name that ends with “entity” can be used to create an AIM statement.AIM 4.0 has two models, AIM Foundation and AIM 4.0. The AIM Foundation model can be extended by imaging experts in a domain area such as molecular imaging and optical imaging. These experts can add additional classes to capture information currently not available in the AIM Foundation model. The AIM 4.0 model includes classes that are required to capture lesion tracking in the domains of radiology and oncology.You can explore images of the
