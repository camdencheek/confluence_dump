Geometric shapes, which are equivalent to markups, describe a user&#39;s region of interest on an image and are patterned after DICOM SR graphical types. Combinations of these shapes can be used to represent graphical drawings placed on images.

          </td>
          <td>
            A series of connected line segments with ordered vertices denoted by (column,row) pairs. If the first and last vertices are the same, it is a closed polygon.

            Circle
          </td>
          <td>
            A circle defined by two (column,row) pairs. The first point is the central pixel. The second point is a pixel on the perimeter of the circle.
