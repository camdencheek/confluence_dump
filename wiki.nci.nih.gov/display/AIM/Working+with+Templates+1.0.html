When you design a template, it is helpful to keep the purpose in mind. A template structures how users will enter information into an imaging application. The following table may help make the connection between the AIM Template Builder and information entered into an imaging application.
<table>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <th>
        AIM Template Builder Concept
      </th>
      <th>

      </th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>
        Component
      </td>
      <td>
        Item being annotated; for example, Tumor Location. A component can be anatomic entity, imaging observation, inference, calculation, and markup or geometric shape.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>
        Characteristic
      </td>
      <td>
        Descriptive element of that item; for example, Site of Tumor Center. Only anatomic entity and imaging observation can have characteristics associated with them.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>
        Allowed Term

      <td>
