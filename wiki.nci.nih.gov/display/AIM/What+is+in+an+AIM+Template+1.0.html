An AIM template contains a collection of data collection items (questions) and possible values (answers) for each question. You create a template for each imaging study. You capture each item and value using a standardized vocabulary.An AIM template has one or more components. Each component represents a study question that may have one or more answers. Template components can be any of the following: anatomic entity, imaging observation, inference, calculation, or geometric shape (markup).Both anatomic entities and imaging observations are also described by their associated characteristics. Anatomic entity and imaging observation characteristics inherit the attributes of their respective component. Characteristics have annotator confidence that allows a user to enter a percentage that represents the level of user confidence in answering the question. A characteristic may also have a quantification value.
