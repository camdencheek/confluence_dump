These terms are called answer choices in ATB 2.0 but were called allowed terms in ATB 1.1. You can associate answer choices with Anatomic Entity, Imaging Observation, and Inference components, and Anatomic Entity and Imaging Observation characteristics.Once you create an answer choice, you can add more answer choices under it hierarchically.
