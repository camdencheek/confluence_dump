    In this version of ATB, a question is defined as a concept code. This means that you will have to select a concept code from a list of existing lexicons from your local ATB. If you don’t have a concept code defined, which you probably don’t have in your local ATB, you will have to create your private lexicon that consists of your set of questions.ExampleYou may want to create the following question: Where is a tumor located? You may define the question as follows.
    <ol>
      <li>
        Create a lexicon called My private questions.
        <ol>
          <li>
