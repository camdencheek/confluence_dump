If the following criteria are all true, you can upload one or more folders from a Globus endpoint to a study in MoDaC:
<ul>
  <li>
    You have a MoDaC user account with upload permission.
  </li>
  <li>
    You are member of a group that has permission to edit that study (or you created that study).
  </li>
  <li>
    You have prepared a Globus endpoint for use with MoDaC. For details, refer to
    <a href="https://wiki.nci.nih.gov/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=434111134" rel="nofollow">
      Preparing to Use Globus
    </a>
    .
  </li>
</ul>
When you upload data, you become the owner of that data. (Ownership cannot be changed.) Each folder from Globus becomes an asset in that study.
<ol>
  <li>
    If you want to provide metadata separately for each asset (or each file), prepare that metadata in a Microsoft Excel XLSX file.
    Instructions to prepare metadata file
    <ol>
      <li>
        Download the example metadata file from the following GitHub location:
        <a href="https://github.com/CBIIT/nci-doe-data-sharing/blob/master/doc/training/samples/example_MoDaC_bulk_metadata.xlsx" rel="nofollow">
          https://github.com/CBIIT/nci-doe-data-sharing/blob/master/doc/training/samples/example_MoDaC_bulk_metadata.xlsx
        </a>
      </li>
      <li>
        Revise the file to reflect the assets (and files) you intend to specify for registration:
        <ul>
          <li>
            Specify a row for each of your assets and each of your files.
          </li>
          <li>
            In the path column, specify the location of each asset and each file within your Globus endpoint.
          </li>
          <li>
            Specify required metadata for each asset:
            <ul>
              <li>
                The character limit for each metadata value is 2700.
              </li>
              <li>
                In the collection_type column, always specify Asset as the collection type.
              </li>
              <li>
                In the asset_type column, specify either Model or Dataset.
              </li>
              <li>
                If Model is the asset type, the system requires platform_name, framework, and domain.
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    Valid values for platform name are AMPL, Candle, None, or Other.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    Valid values for framework are Tensorflow, TensorRT, PyTorch, Caffe, Caffe2, Scikit-learn, Keras, DALI, ONNX, or Other.
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>
                For both asset types, the system requires asset_identifier, asset_name, and description.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            (Optional) In additional columns, specify user-defined attributes for each asset and each file.
          </li>
          <li>
            Each file can be any file type.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>

  <li>
    Click Register Asset. Click Upload Asset(s) from Globus Endpoint. Click Select Assets from Globus Endpoint. A Globus page appears.
  </li>
  <li>
    In Globus, select an endpoint. Select the folders that you want to upload. Click Submit. The upload page reappears with the Globus endpoint ID, path, and selected folders.
  </li>
  <li>
    (Optional) Specify include criteria. Use patterns to specify the source files to include. If you specify more than one pattern, the system considers a union of all patterns. For details, refer to

  <li>
    Specify whether you want to upload a bulk metadata file:
    <ul>
      <li>
        If you select Yes, then click Choose File. Navigate to and select your file. The filename appears next to the Choose File button.
      </li>
      <li>
        If you select No, then select the asset type and specify all required metadata. If you want to add metadata, click Add Metadata. The system adds a row to the metadata table. Specify an attribute name and an attribute value. (Repeat for additional attributes. To delete an attribute, click the X.) Keep in mind the following points:
        <ul>
          <li>
            The character limit for each metadata value is 2700.
          </li>
          <li>
            If an attribute value begins with http or https, MoDaC displays it as a hyperlink in read-only fields.
