Each collection (at the asset level or higher) can have separate edit permissions. These permissions govern who can perform the following tasks:
<ul>
  <li>
    Change metadata, as described in
    <a href="https://wiki.nci.nih.gov/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=431882681" rel="nofollow">
      Editing Metadata
    </a>
    .
  </li>
  <li>
    Add files or subcollections, as described in
    <a href="https://wiki.nci.nih.gov/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=431882675" rel="nofollow">
      Uploading Data
    </a>
    .
  </li>
  <li>
    Delete files or subcollections, as described in
    <a href="https://wiki.nci.nih.gov/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=434111885" rel="nofollow">
      Deleting Data
    </a>
    .
  </li>
</ul>
You can manage these permissions by specifying one or more user groups for each collection. By default, subcollections inherit the edit permissions of their parent collections. For example, users who have edit permissions for a program can edit any metadata in that program, its studies, or their assets. Users who have permissions to a edit a study can edit any metadata in that study or its assets.  Contents
