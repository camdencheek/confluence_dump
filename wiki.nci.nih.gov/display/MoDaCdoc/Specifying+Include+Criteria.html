When you specify include criteria, you can specify either RegEx pattern or a simple pattern.
<ul>
  <li>
    With RegEx, the search pattern can be a simple character, a fixed string, or a complex expression containing special characters describing the pattern. The pattern defined by RegEx may match one time, several times, or not at all for a given string. For patterns and examples, refer to the following page:
