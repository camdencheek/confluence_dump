If you are a researcher, you can use your input and outcome files to find models in MoDaC that suit your purposes. You can create a reference dataset in MoDaC, upload an input file and an outcome file to it, and then perform a model analysis. A reference dataset is a type of asset. You can add an asset to an existing study if the following criteria are true:
<ul>
  <li>
    You have a MoDaC user account with upload permission.
  </li>
  <li>
    You are member of a group that has permission to edit that study (or you created that study).
  </li>
</ul>
When you create a collection, you become the owner of that collection. (Ownership cannot be changed.)

    Click Register Asset. Click Register Empty Asset. The Select Asset Type dialog box appears.
  </li>
  <li>
    From the Asset Type list, select Dataset. Click Select. The Register Asset page appears.
  </li>
  <li>
    Specify the information for the new collection:
    <ul>
      <li>
        In the Permissions field, select one or more groups from the list. (If the Permissions field is empty, only you, as the person who created the collection, can edit the metadata, add files, or add subcollections.)
      </li>
      <li>
        To add a metadata attribute, click Add Metadata. A blank attribute row appears. Specify a unique attribute name. (Repeat for additional attributes. To delete an attribute, click the X.)
      </li>
      <li>
        If the collection is public and you do not want the public to have access to the data, clear the Public checkbox and select one or more groups from the list.
      </li>
      <li>
        In the Is Reference Dataset field, select Yes. Additional fields appear:
        <ul>
          <li>
            Select one or more applicable models.
          </li>
          <li>
            Specify an outcome file name.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        Specify a value for each required metadata attribute. Keep in mind the following points:
        <ul>
          <li>
            The character limit for each metadata value is 2700.
          </li>
          <li>
            Once you register the collection, the identifier is permanent.
          </li>
          <li>
            If an attribute value begins with http or https, MoDaC displays it as a hyperlink in read-only fields.
          </li>
          <li>

    When you have finished specifying information for the new collection, click Register Asset. A message appears, confirming the collection creation. The system requires an input file and an outcome file in the reference dataset. The following pages describe the input and outcome files for each model:
