If a collection is public, each sub-collection can be public or non-public. If the following conditions are both true, you can manage which groups can access a collection:
<ul>
  <li>
    You own the collection. That is, you created it, as described in
    <a href="https://wiki.nci.nih.gov/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=434111512" rel="nofollow">
      Adding a Collection
    </a>
    .
  </li>
  <li>
    The collection is a program, or the parent collection is public.
  </li>
</ul>
If a collection is non-public, all subcollections inherit its group access. You cannot make those subcollections public. If you own the parent collection, consider changing the group access for that collection instead. Otherwise, you can request a change by selecting About &gt; Contact. For details, refer to
