        Attribute values associated with your data in the archive. Metadata describe the data, such as the date and origin of creation, its contents, its condition, its processing, or its associations to other objects. Metadata can make data searches faster, more specific, and also enable and promote data sharing among scientists.Â The system automatically generates some metadata for each collection or file in the archive. Some data might also have custom (user-defined) attributes.
