If you are a researcher, you can use your input and outcome files to find models in MoDaC that suit your purposes. If all of the following conditions are true, you can generate predictions from a model asset collection:
<ul>
  <li>
    You have a MoDaC user account with upload permission.
  </li>
  <li>
    You belong to a group that can modify that model.
  </li>
  <li>
    That model is available for analysis.
  </li>
</ul>
To generate predictions:
