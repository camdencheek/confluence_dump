If you have a MoDaC user account with upload permission, you can add a collection (such as a program, study, asset, or subcollection) as follows:
<ul>
  <li>
    You can add a program.
  </li>
  <li>
    If you are member of a group that has permission to edit an existing program (or if you created a program), you can add a study to that program.
  </li>
  <li>
    If you are member of a group that has permission to edit an existing study (or if you created a study), you can add an asset to that study.
  </li>
  <li>
    If you are member of a group that has permission to edit an existing asset (or if you created an asset), you can add a subcollection to that asset.
  </li>
</ul>
If you have a user account with upload permission and if you are member of a group that has permission to edit an asset in MoDaC (or if you created that asset), you can upload data to that asset (or to a subcollection of that asset), as follows:
<ul>
  <li>
    You can upload one file at a time from your local system, if each file is 5 GB or less.
  </li>
  <li>
    If you have read access to a Globus endpoint, you can upload one or more files from that endpoint. (You can upload them to one or more assets in MoDaC.)
  </li>
  <li>
    If you have read access to an AWS S3 bucket, Google Drive folder, or Google Cloud bucket, you can upload one or more files from it.
  </li>
</ul>
When you create a collection or upload data, you become the owner of that collection or data. (Ownership cannot be changed.) The system requires metadata for all collections (at the asset level or higher), but metadata attributes are optional for files. You can also add metadata to a subcollection (within an asset), but keyword searches find assets based on metadata at the asset level or higher.The character limit for each metadata value is 2700. The following characters are not supported in MoDaC metadata:
<ul>
  <li>
    single-quote or apostrophe: &#39; ‘ ’
  </li>
  <li>
    double-quote: &#34; “ ”
  </li>
</ul>
Also, do not copy text from Microsoft Word into MoDaC metadata.Contents
