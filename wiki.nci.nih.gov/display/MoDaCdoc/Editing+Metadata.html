When a user creates a collection (at the asset level or higher) or uploads a file, that user can specify which groups can modify the metadata for that collection or file. If you belong to one of those groups, you can modify the metadata for that collection or file.The character limit for each metadata value is 2700. The following characters are not supported in MoDaC metadata:
<ul>
  <li>
    single-quote or apostrophe: &#39; ‘ ’
  </li>
  <li>
    double-quote: &#34; “ ”
  </li>
</ul>
Also, do not copy text from Microsoft Word into MoDaC metadata.Contents
