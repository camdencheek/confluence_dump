The Predictive Oncology Model and Data Clearinghouse (MoDaC) is a data repository and model clearinghouse developed to transition resources to the broader research community. These resources consist of predictive oncology datasets and mathematical models (such as machine learning and deep learning models) developed within NCI and in collaborative programs. These programs include the NCI-DOE Collaboration projects and the

. MoDaC supports the community priority for making both data and predictive models FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable). MoDaC also fosters reproducibility and supports collaborations among groups developing computational predictive models, including collaborations with the US Department of Energy.The following table summarizes the tasks you can perform in the MoDaC web application (GUI):
