<ul>
  <li>
    Your user account has the group administrator role.
  </li>

    You own that collection. For information on the Own permission level, refer to

  </li>
</ul>
To delete a collection:
<ol>
  <li>
    Run the following command:











    dm_delete_collection [optional parameters] &lt;collection-path&gt;


    The following table describes each parameter:
    <table>
      <colgroup>
        <col/>
        <col/>
      </colgroup>
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <th>
            Parameter
          </th>
          <th>
            Description
          </th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>
            [-f]
          </td>
          <td>
            By default, the system performs a soft deletion. The system retains the specified collection for two years and then permanently deletes it. To perform immediately permanent deletion, include the -f parameter.
          </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>
            [-r]
          </td>
          <td>
            An optional parameter:
            <ul>
              <li>
                If you specify this parameter, the system deletes all the files and subcollections under the specified collection recursively.
              </li>
              <li>
                If you do not specify this parameter, the system deletes the collection only if it is empty.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>
            &lt;collection-path&gt;
          </td>
          <td>
            A path within DME. Specify the collection that you want to delete.
          </td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>
    The system prompts you to confirm the deletion.
  </li>
  <li>
    Type Y and press Enter. If you specified the recursive (-r) parameter, the system asks whether you want to see the data that will be deleted.
  </li>
  <li>
    Respond to the prompt and press Enter. The system lists or describes the data to be deleted and prompts you to confirm the deletion again.
  </li>
  <li>
    Type Y and press Enter. The system responds based on your parameters.
  </li>
</ol>
For example, the following command deletes the  /Example_Archive/downloads collection, all subcollections within that collection, and all files within those collections.











dm_delete_collection –r /Example_Archive/downloads
