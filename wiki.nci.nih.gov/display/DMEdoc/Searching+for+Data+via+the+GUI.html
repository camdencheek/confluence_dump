If your user account has the Read, Write, or Own permission level on a collection or data file in DME and if you know some attributes for the collection or data file, you can search for that data. When you perform a search in DME, the system searches both self metadata and parent metadata. New collections, data files, and links appear in search results 30-60 minutes after they were created.To search for data:
<ol>
  <li>
    Log in as described in

    . The Dashboard appears.
  </li>
  <li>
    Select a method:
    <ul>
      <li>
        If you want to perform a new search: Click the Search tab.
      </li>
      <li>
        If you want to edit an existing saved search: In the Dashboard, locate the row for the saved search you want to edit. In that row, click the edit icon.

  </li>
  <li>
    Specify whether you want to search for a collection or a data object (data file). This selection clears any previous selections in other fields.
  </li>
  <li>
    Specify at least one metadata criterion:
    <ol>
      <li>
        Specify whether to include or exclude parent metadata. By default, if the criteria is satisfied in either the self metadata or the parent metadata of a collection or data file, the system includes that collection or data file in the search results. If you want the system to consider only the self metadata, select Exclude Parent Metadata.
      </li>
      <li>
        (Optional) Click the Level field. The system lists the hierarchy levels (collection types) to which you have read access. In the text box, type a value. The system lists only the level names that contain the specified value. Select the level in which you want to search.
        <ul>
          <li>
            If you select a level, the system updates the list of available attribute names and clears any previous selection in the Attribute Name field.
          </li>
          <li>
            If you do not select a level, the system performs the search at all levels.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        (Optional) Click the Attribute Name field. In the text box, type a value. The system lists only the attribute names that contain the specified value. Select an attribute name.
      </li>
      <li>
        Select an operator. The following table describes the available options:

      <li>
        For each non-date operator, specify a value. Keep in mind the following points:
        <ul>
          <li>
            The system ignores capitalization in this field. For example, &#34;SMITH&#34; and &#34;smith&#34; produce the same results.
          </li>
          <li>
            The system recognizes an underscore character (_) as a wild card for any single character.
          </li>
          <li>
            The system recognizes a percent character (%) as a wild card for any number of characters (zero, one, or more).
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        For each date operator, specify a date. Keep in mind the following points:
        <ul>
          <li>
            You can select a date from the calendar or type a value.
          </li>
          <li>
            The system assumes the date format is &#34;MM-DD-YYYY HH24:MI:SS&#34; (for example &#34;12-31-2019 23:52:51&#34;).
          </li>
          <li>
            If you want to search by a date attribute that has a metadata validation rule in a different format, use CLU instead. For details, refer to

  <li>
    (Optional) Click Add Criteria and repeat the previous step. The system assigns IDs to the metadata criteria (A1, A2, and so on).
  </li>
  <li>
    (Optional) Click Advanced Search and specify a search query. Keep in mind the following points:
    <ul>
      <li>
        Specify the search IDs for the metadata criteria you have already specified.
      </li>
      <li>
        Use one or more logical operators (capitalized as AND, OR).
      </li>
      <li>
        Consider using parentheses. The system assesses the expressions within parentheses first.
      </li>
      <li>
        Consider the following example: (A1 OR A2) AND (A3 OR A4)
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    (Optional) Clear Detailed Results.
    <ul>
      <li>
        By default, all columns are available in the search results for both collections and data files. This includes columns for UUID, Registered By, Collection Type (for collections), Checksum (for data files), and Created On (and columns for self metadata and parent metadata). In this case, the results page also includes the total size of selected collections or data files.
      </li>
      <li>
        If you proceed without the detailed results option, the results page include only the Path, Download, and Permission columns. In this case, the results page does not include the total size of selected collections or data files.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    Click Search. The search results page appears. Keep in mind the following points:
    <ul>
      <li>
        If you have more than one metadata criterion and have not specified a search query, the system combines your criteria with AND, narrowing your search.
      </li>
      <li>
        For each criterion using the LIKE operator, the system automatically adds percent character (%) wild card before and after the attribute value search string.
      </li>
      <li>
