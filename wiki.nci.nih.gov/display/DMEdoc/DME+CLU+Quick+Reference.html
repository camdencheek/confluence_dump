        The following command creates a Project_New collection within the PI_Lab1 collection and applies to that new collection the metadata in the collection-metadata.json file:











        dm_register_collection $HPC_DM_UTILS/templates/collection-metadata.json /Test_Archive/PI_Lab1/Project_New


        Replace the DME path (/Test_Archive/PI_Lab1/Project_New) with a DME path to which you have write access. The JSON file must contain metadata for the new collection, Project_New. If the parent collection, PI_Lab1, does not already exist, then the JSON file must also contain metadata for that collection.
