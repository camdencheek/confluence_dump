The process of uploading data to DME includes annotating that data with metadata, so this user guide uses the term registering for this process. If your user account has the Write or Own permission level on an existing collection in DME, you can register data into that collection in the following ways:
<ul>
  <li>
    If the collection has any user metadata, you can update that metadata.
  </li>
  <li>
    If that existing collection has been configured to contain another collection, you can add a collection.
  </li>
  <li>
    If that existing collection has been configured to contain data files, you can add files.
  </li>
</ul>
Consider registering data using the web application (GUI) or Command Line Utilities (CLU).

    If you want fine-grained control of the activity, or if you want to integrate it into your scientific workflow, consider using CLU.
  </li>

    Otherwise, consider using the GUI.
