      <li>
        In the User or Group field, start typing a value:
        <ul>
          <li>
            In the User field, start typing a user&#39;s first name, last name, or user ID. The system suggests names of matching users as you type. Select one of the suggested names. Repeat this process to add additional users.
          </li>
          <li>
            In the Group field, start typing a group name. The system suggests names of matching groups as you type. Select one of the suggested names. Repeat this process to add additional groups.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        In the Permissions field, select Own, Write, or Read.
      </li>
      <li>
        Click Save. The system adds the selected users or groups to the list on the Permissions page and displays a message to indicate whether the permissions for the collection or file were updated successfully.

      </li>
      <li>
        In the row for the user or group of interest, select the permission level you want that user or group to have. The following table describes each permission level:

                All users can view reports and subscribe to notifications. However, if you assign to a user or group the None permission level for a collection or a data file, that user or group will not be able to view, download, or edit that data, or assign permissions to access that data.

        Click Save. The system displays a message to indicate whether the permissions for the collection or file were updated successfully. Also, the system sorts the list alphabetically by type (group or user) and then by name.
