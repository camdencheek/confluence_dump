If you need to move a large volume of data, you can do so using an AWS S3 bucket. DME uses AWS for high performance transfer of large files. If you intend to use an S3 bucket with the DME CLU, prepare as follows:
<ol>
  <li>
    Use a command line editor (such as vi editor) to create a file with the filename credentials that specifies S3 credential information, as follows:
    [default]
    aws_access_key_id = &lt;access key&gt;
    aws_secret_access_key = &lt;secret access key&gt;
    region = &lt;s3 region&gt;
  </li>
  <li>
    Consider placing the credentials file in the default location for CLU commands, as follows:











    ~/.aws/credentials
  </li>
</ol>
Now you can download data as described in the following pages:
