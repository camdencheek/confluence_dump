When a group administrator creates a user, the system associates that user with that group administrator&#39;s DOC. If the following conditions are all true, you can update a user:
<ul>
  <li>
    Your user account has the group administrator role.
  </li>
  <li>
    You have the same DOC as the user.
  </li>
  <li>
    The user is not a system administrator.
  </li>
</ul>
To update the user:
