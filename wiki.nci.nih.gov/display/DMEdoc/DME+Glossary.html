      <td>
        A folder for a dataset or project. A collection might have one or more collections within it. A collection can be identified by a custom collection type such as Project, Study, Sample, and so on, the default being Folder.

    <tr>
      <td>
        metadata
      </td>
      <td>
        Attribute values associated with your data in the archive. Metadata describe the data, such as the date and origin of creation, its contents, its condition, its processing, or its associations to other objects. Metadata can make data searches faster, more specific, and also enable and promote data sharing among scientists. The system automatically generates some metadata for each collection or file in the archive. Some data might also have custom (user-defined) attributes. The DOC policy file specifies the required attributes for each collection type. If the DOC policy file specifies that a particular attribute is required for a particular collection type, then DME requires a value for that attribute during registration.
