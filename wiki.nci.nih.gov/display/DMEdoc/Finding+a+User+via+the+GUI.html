    In one or more fields, consider specifying a value. The system ignores capitalization in all fields. For example, &#34;SMITH&#34; and &#34;smith&#34; produce the same results. The following table provides more details about each field:
    <table>
      <colgroup>
        <col/>
        <col/>
      </colgroup>
      <tbody>

        <tr>

            User ID
          </td>
          <td>
            Specify the user&#39;s NIH user ID. In this field, the system does not recognize any wild card characters.

        <tr>

            First Name
          </td>
          <td>
            Specify the user&#39;s first name. In this field, the system recognizes an underscore character (_) as a wild card for any single character, or a percent character (%) as a wild card for any number of characters (zero, one, or more).

        </tr>
        <tr>

          <td>
            Specify the user&#39;s last name. In this field, the system recognizes wild cards as described above for the First Name field.
