A bookmark allows you to quickly access a collection or data file of interest. If your user account has the Read, Write, or Own permission level on any collection or data file in DME, you can create a bookmark on that collection or data file. If your user account has the group administrator or system administrator role, the dm_add_bookmark command also allows you to add a bookmark for another user and set permissions for that user at the same time. With the same command, you can provide permissions for a group of users, or for a user account that does not exist as a DME user yet.
<ol>
  <li>
    In your local system, create a JSON file that specifies the path within DME for the bookmark. For general usage information about the dm_add_bookmark command, refer to

    . As an administrator, you can specify additional parameters (userId and permission) in the JSON file:
    {
    &#34;path&#34; : &#34;/Path/To/Bookmark&#34;,
    &#34;userId&#34; : &#34;user ID or group name&#34;,
    &#34;permission&#34;: &#34;The permission to set for the path, in ALL CAPS&#34;
    }
    The system accepts the following capitalized values for the permission field:
    <ul>
      <li>
        OWN
      </li>
      <li>
        WRITE
      </li>
      <li>
        READ
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    Run the dm_add_bookmark command as described in
    <a href="https://wiki.nci.nih.gov/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=392071330" rel="nofollow">
      Adding a Bookmark via the CLU
    </a>
    . The system responds as follows:
    <ul>
      <li>
        If your JSON file specifies a bookmark path for an existing DME user, but does not specify a permission level for that user, then the system leaves the existing permission level as it is.
      </li>
      <li>
        If your JSON file specifies an NIH user account that does not exist as a DME user yet, and specifies a permission level for that user, the system creates that user in DME with the specified permission level.
      </li>
      <li>
        The system creates the user in the DOC with which you are affiliated, and does not set a base path.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    Ask the specified user or group of users to log out of DME and log in again.
  </li>
</ol>
For example, consider the following command:











dm_add_bookmark MyCollection /cygdrive/c/Users/JaneDoe/my-bookmark.json


With the following code in the specified my-bookmark.json file, the command gives the doejohn9 user Write access to the PI_Lab1 collection, creates a bookmark named MyCollection for that user, and associates the bookmark with the PI_Lab1 collection:
{
&#34;path&#34; : &#34;/Example_Archive/PI_Lab1&#34;,
&#34;userId&#34; : &#34;doejohn9&#34;,
&#34;permission&#34;: &#34;WRITE&#34;
}
