DME requires the UUID of your Globus shared endpoint in the following scenarios:
<ul>
  <li>
    If you use the GUI to download data from DME to a Globus endpoint and you choose to specify your endpoint manually
  </li>
  <li>
    If you use the CLU to download data from DME to a Globus endpoint or to register data from that endpoint into DME
  </li>
</ul>
Each time you need the UUID, perform the following steps:
<ol>
  <li>
    Prepare to use Globus, as described in
