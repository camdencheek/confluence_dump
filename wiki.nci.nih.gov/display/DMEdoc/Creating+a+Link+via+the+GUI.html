A link in DME is a pointer to a file, similar to a UNIX soft link. If a file already exists in DME, you can create a link to it, instead of registering it again. Initially, a link has the same user metadata as the source file, but you can change the user metadata of the link, or add user metadata to it. These changes are separate from metadata changes for the source file. Each link has &#34;link_source_path&#34; as a system metadata attribute, specifying the source file. To create a link:
<ol>
  <li>
    Perform a search for the data file, as described in

  <li>
    Click Submit. The response from the system depends on your selection:

        If you clicked the link icon above the list of files, the system displays a &#34;Link creation request submitted&#34; message and adds an entry to the Registration Tasks page. Depending on your event subscriptions, the system might send you an email notification with details about the link creation. For instructions on subscribing, refer to
