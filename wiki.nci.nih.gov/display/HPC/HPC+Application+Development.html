  IntroCancer researchers generate a massive amount—and high volume—of data. This presents continual challenges for scientists to access, analyze, manage, and share their data with other researchers across the globe. Scientific computational tools must be robust, reliable, effective, and affordable.At NCI, we have developed innovative High Performance (HPC) and Scientific Computing services that offer reliable, high-speed data management and information delivery solutions to help investigators accelerate and advance their cancer research.We work closely with investigators across NCI to develop, optimize and/or validate HPC applications—and computing technologies—that enable rapid data transfer and provide effective data management.


  What We Do We optimize and develop HPC applications to improve performance and increase speed on (HPC) systems. Our Service IncludesHPC Application Optimization
