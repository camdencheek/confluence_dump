   Overview of the 2018 MeetingNow in its third year, the 2018 Frontiers of Predictive Oncology and Computing meeting (FPOC III) will highlight the disruptions and innovations that will help support and enhance physicians&#39; and oncologists’ point-of-care decisions for cancer patients. By incorporating a critical view of key factors involved in reaching the cancer patient and the physician, the 2018 meeting will explore and integrate new ideas for predictive oncology to deliver the maximum patient impact. In broad themes, the meeting will emphasize the following primary topics:2018 Planned ThemesPatient First Opportunities: Bedside to Bench to Bedside – This session highlights research and innovations that focus first and foremost on impact to cancer patients. The session will include useful perspectives on new opportunities and developing ideas in predictive oncology and computing that start first from the bedside—then to the bench—and back to the bedside.Broader Perspectives: Beyond Oncology and Borders – This session focuses on how insights learned from efforts to advance predictive capabilities in other diseases can be leveraged to identify and refine opportunities to advance the frontiers of predictive oncology and computing. This session will provide insight on innovative research approaches in the United States and across the globe. The session also includes perspectives involving both traditional and non-traditional research settings in industry, academia, and government.Closing the Gap Between Research and Clinic – To accelerate new advances in patient impact, there is an ever-present need to build bridges across disciplines, communities, and interests. This session will focus on identifying and closing gaps in key areas, including technology, education, regulation, social acceptance, and workforce capabilities that may limit the adoption of advances in predictive oncology and computing.Disruptions and Innovations: Advancing the Frontier and Looking Ahead – This session focuses on technological, social, and economic innovations and disruptions on the horizon that affect the frontiers of predictive oncology and computing. These disruptions and innovations include the broad use of technology, data driven models, artificial intelligence, computing, persistent health monitoring, and other factors that have the potential to disrupt how cancer care is delivered—and patient impact is achieved—in the future.History of the Frontiers of Predictive Oncology and Computing (FPOC) MeetingThe Frontiers of Predictive Oncology and Computing (FPOC) meetings are hosted by

  .The BAASIC program is itself a component of DOE’s Computational Predictive Biology program and focuses on exploring the opportunities and challenges involved in bringing together advanced computing and the life sciences. The goal of this synthesis is to apply the power of extreme computing, big-data analysis, and the explosion of knowledge in life sciences to make possible predictive simulations of human biology and, within that framework, transform the promise of predictive oncology into a reality guiding the clinical care of cancer patients. Realizing this goal requires the creation of a new generation of simulation tools and analytical approaches that can address research challenges of unprecedented complexity. The FPOC meetings offer a unique opportunity for thought leaders from leading public and private-sector organizations to meet and share ideas and new approaches to predictive oncology and computing. Through a series of presentations, interactive sessions, and informal discussions, the participants engage in a multidisciplinary exploration of critical issues, challenges, and opportunities for accelerating the broader impact—and patient benefit—from both computing technology and predictive oncology. The first Frontiers of Predictive Oncology and Computing (FPOC) meeting was held in July 2016 in Washington, DC. At this meeting over 100 thought leaders from industry, government and academia converged to share insights, knowledge, and a vision for the future of computationally predictive oncology.

  .The theme of the second Frontiers of Predictive Oncology and Computing meeting (FPOC II), held in October 2017 in New York City, was “computational pathology.” Discussions at FPOC II focused on the broader application of technology, computation, and domain expertise to understand and describe the specifics of cancer as a disease.
