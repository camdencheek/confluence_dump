CBIIT HPC StrategyWith a focus on providing robust and reliable solutions enabling NCI investigators to utilize HPC in their efforts, the CBIIT HPC strategy is focused on these interconnected areas:
<ul>
  <li>
    Working closely with investigators across NCI to enable broader utilization of HPC through HPC training, education and reliable system access
  </li>
  <li>
    Guided by investigator challenges and opportunities, provide support and consulting for HPC needs as well as development, optimization and/or validation of HPC applications useful to cancer research and clinical applications
  </li>
  <li>
    Effective data management and information delivery solutions in support of HPC applications used in cancer research
  </li>
  <li>
    Exploration and evaluation of emerging HPC technologies for use in cancer research, information delivery and data center operations
  </li>
  <li>
    Developing essential partnerships within NCI, NIH, HHS, government, academically, commercially, nationally and internationally fostering the expanded use of HPC in cancer research
  </li>
  <li>
    Develop and deliver services supporting current and future HPC needs of NCI investigators
  </li>
  <li>
    Continual incorporation of investigator input to improve and evolve HPC services, capabilities and opportunities
  </li>
</ul>
 Long Range Guiding Objectives for HPC in Cancer ResearchWith guidance and insight provided by the cancer research and clinical community within NCI, deliver robust, reliable HPC capabilities and support that:
<ul>
  <li>
    Enable broader understanding of cancer, cancer system dynamics and cancer characterizations
  </li>
  <li>
    Enable rapid identification of potential cancer risks and presence of cancer in individuals
  </li>
  <li>
    Enable rapid determination of optimal treatment options for patients
  </li>
  <li>
    Expand treatment options through improved discovery and rapid, reliable validation
  </li>
  <li>
    Foster computational integration and cooperation across the global cancer research community
  </li>
  <li>
    Enable transfer and flow of HPC technologies between NCI and other stakeholders
  </li>
  <li>
    Enable NCI to take full advantage of computational advances to accelerate cancer research
  </li>
</ul>
