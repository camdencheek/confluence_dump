          There might be room for CBIIT to participate? I think that other government agencies would be very interested in hearing how NCI is approaching AWS.Natasha Clark (Co-Organizer) sent a message to the Arlington VA AWS Meetup mailing list - call for presentersHi Everyone!I wanted to reach out to see if any of you would be interested in presenting at our October session, scheduled for Thursday, October 26th at Excella.Depending on interest, we can either make this a lightning talk session or keynote depending on length. As always, we are always interested in all things AWS and below are a few topics we have had interest for in the past.If any of these sound like they might be right up your alley, or if you have another topic in mind, please reach out to me via the messaging feature on the

          Modern text editors have higher latency than 42-year-old Emacs. Text editors! What can be simpler? On each keystroke, all you have to do is update tiny rectangular region and modern text editors can’t do that in 16ms. It’s a lot of time. A LOT. A 3D game can fill the whole screen with hundreds of thousands (!!!) of polygons in the same 16ms and also process input, recalculate the world and dynamically load/unload resources. How come?

Seating is first come first serve.As computational work becomes increasingly embedded in biomedical research practices, computational reproducibility has become an issue of increasing importance. Computational reproducibility requires that other researchers are able to deploy and use software and analysis workflows in their own computing environments. Platforms like Docker and Singularity allow the creation and configuration of software containers, which can be distributed and deployed across a range of systems. This lecture, presented by Steve Tsang, will give an introductory overview of containerization and how containers can facilitate reproducible bioinformatics research, providing examples from the NCI Cloud Resources and various hackathons.Seating is limited, but the presentation will be available through Webex (calendar invite attached).

Researchers from Graz University of Technology, including one of the original Meltdown discoverers, Daniel Gruss, have described NetSpectre: a fully remote attack based on Spectre.

To ensure reproducibility and reusability of the AMI, we used packer to automate the creation of the AMI directly from a json file, eliminating any hand-editing or configuration of the machine. I describe this process very briefly in a blog post here:

          This affected my El Capitan 10.11 system; the default Python on macOS 10.12+ is hopefully unaffected.Installing the latest Python 2.x using Homebrew worked fine for me, after upgrading Ruby as well.Fun stuff.

          The White House’s American Technology Council and Office of American Innovation on modernizing federal technology published specific recommendations to jumpstart a new wave of modernization efforts by accelerating cloud adoption, consolidating networks and prioritizing key applications for needed upgrades.  Now the daunting task of implementing these recommendations sits within agencies, and it is not a one size fits all proposition.  Where do they begin to successfully move away from expensive legacy infrastructure? How dothey transition to a more secure, agile, and cost-effective technology ecosystem, much of which will be supported by shared services? Join i360Gov and senior level technology leaders from government and industry as we provide an overview of current initiatives and solutions to the many IT modernization challenges agencies face, such as:·       Maintenance that often requires immediate attention and runs the risk of breaking integrations and upgrades ·       Legacy solutions that are unable to properly communicate between on-premises, mobile, and the cloud ·       Citizen facing services not designed for today’s technology environment You will also learn about Identity, the hidden accelerator to IT modernization, and how by creating a single solution for identity, agencies can speed up digital and cloud programs that will enable you to:·       Reduce costs and architecture complexity ·       Securely connect any employee, vendor, partner or citizen to any resource, on premise or in the cloud ·       Make administrators self-sufficient and decrease reliance on customization ·       Scale seamlessly as you move services into the cloud Webinar Presenters·       Dr. Ronald Ross, Computer Scientist, NIST Fellow ·       David Hogue, Technical Director, Cybersecurity Threat Operations Center, NSA ·       Joe Diamond, Director, Cybersecurity Strategy, Okta Register now for this complimentary, educational webinar.

          Melina Scotto: &#39;A reminder that the hash used in GIT is SHA1. Deprecated for government use since 2013. Great to play with, though.&#39;Jeff Shilling: &#39;Since Git is not using SHA1 for cryptographic functions but as a hash of the files to determine if changes to the files have taken place, it doesn’t pose a security concern.&#39;

          Here is the abstract:Progress in biotechnology is continually leading to new types of data, resulting in data sets that are rapidly increasing in volume, resolution and diversity. The promise of unprecedented advances in our understanding of biological systems and in medicine is challenged by complexity and volume of data also challenge scientists’ ability to analyze them. Meeting this challenge requires continuous improvements in analytical methods and capable, usable software tools implementing them. Bioconductor is a well-established open-source, open-development software project for the analysis and comprehension of high-throughput data in genomics and molecular biology. The project aims to enable interdisciplinary research, collaboration and rapid development of scientific software. Based on the statistical programming language R, Bioconductor comprises 1473 interoperable packages contributed by a large, diverse community of scientists. These packages undergo formal initial review and continuous automated testing. Each package includes documentation and working example use cases. Bioconductor supports many types of high-throughput sequencing data (including DNA, RNA, chromatin immunoprecipitation, Hi-C, methylomes and ribosome profiling) and associated annotation resources; contains mature facilities for microarray analysis; and covers proteomic, metabolomic, flow cytometry, quantitative imaging, cheminformatic and other high-throughput data. Bioconductor package interoperability enables the rapid creation of workflows combining and integrating multiple data types and tools for statistical inference, regression, network analysis, machine learning and visualization at all stages of a project from data generation to publication. A large and growing community of researchers and users contribute to ongoing development, online support, and education. The influence of the project is evidenced by more than 250,000 downloads per year and tens of thousands of citations in the literature. I will present an overview of the project for prospective users and contributors.

And yesterday they took this a step further by providing you with alerts when vulnerabilities are detected in any of those dependencies.

Currently, this works for Ruby and Javascript, but Python is coming sometime in 2018.Dependency Graphs

Our CSRA team at NIAID assisted by developing a PaaS solution they’ve named Monarch, discussed in the presentation, that assists with this work leveraging a full DevOps pipeline.For background, Nephele, discussed in the presentation, is a project that a team in BCBB has been working on for several years now.  Due to the infrastructure group (OEB) not having a defined service offering for public cloud at NIAID years ago when Nephele started, the project team went out on their own and architected a solution using AWS.  Within the last year, CSRA consulted with them and provided some guidance for best practices and improvements now that we are launching a custom platform as a service using open source technologies and AWS services.  In the future, we’ll be moving Nephele components to the custom PaaS we created called Monarch and hosting it under our architecture.

          Here&#39;s a TEDx talk about how normal (i.e. non-academic) people can be enlisted to support certain classes of scientific research.  As the talk alludes, there are many possibilities for leveraging citizen science, and it is useful to think about the technologies available and the ways people interact with technology (like gaming or idle time-wasting on a cellphone) to understand those possibilities. The value of citizen science is not just in distributed data collection or analytical tasks that are currently easier for humans than computers.  It is also the engagement of more people in the purpose, goals and problems of current research efforts.

          Found these two articles related to Oracle’s new pricing strategy which effectively doubles the cost to run Oracle products in AWS. For those of you that have worked with Oracle over the years, I’m sure this isn’t a big surprise, but as we move to the cloud it may be a driver to move to other database platforms such as AWS RDS or Red Shift on AWS. Of course I suppose there’s always the Oracle cloud.

          Watson provides clinicians with evidence-based treatment options based on expert training by MSK physicians.Whether a community oncology practice or an international hospital, oncologists like all clinicians are struggling to keep up with the large volume of research, medical records, and clinical trials. Watson scales vital knowledge and helps oncologists. Now, with the collaboration between IBM and MSK, Watson for Oncology utilizes world-renowned MSK expertise to evaluate specific details of each unique patient against clinical evidence.

          SQL is of course a mainstay; Python is big, R is big, and SAS is declining but big and not going anywhere soon.  Java and Hadoop are also commonly used.The methodology used to track these trends involves data from job postings.  Specific trends within cancer research are likely to be somewhat different.

          Towards open and reproducible neuroscience in the age of big dataAbstract:The Stanford Center for Reproducible Neuroscience (CRN) was founded to develop a number of initiatives to help to make neuroscience more open and reproducible. These initiatives include influencing the scientific culture (e.g. The OHBM Replication Award), introducing new standards for organizing neuroimaging data (BIDS) and software (BIDS Apps) as well as building tools to assess MRI quality (MRIQC) and perform robust preprocessing of fMRI data (FMRIPREP). Tying all of those efforts together, as well as capitalizing on the experience gained from OpenfMRI and NeuroVault, is the upcoming OpenNeuro project. This novel software-as-a-service platform seeks to harness the power of high-performance computers to provide free data analysis in exchange for making data publicly available.There is a nice technology feature article in Nature on &#34;big data&#34; in Neuroscience, touching on many of those parallels -- data management when dealing with 100s of terabytes, attitudes toward data sharing, and the notion that in many cases &#34;big data&#34; is still not enough data.Neuroscience: Big brain, big data
