). caNanoLab is a data sharing portal that supports the international biomedical nanotechnology research community to expedite and validate the use of nanotechnology in biomedicine. caNanoLab provides support to annotate nanomaterials with characterizations resulting from physico-chemical, in vitro, and in vivo assays and share characterizations and associated nanotechnology protocols in a secure environment.caNanoLab provides support and functionality for the following features:
<ul>
  <li>
    Protocol management – Search, submit, and edit nanotechnology protocols leveraged in performing sample characterization assays
  </li>
  <li>
    Sample management – Search, submit, and edit information on sample formulations including the composition of the sample, results of sample physico-chemical, in vitro, in vivo, and other characterizations, and associated publications
  </li>
  <li>
    Publication management – Search, submit, and edit information on nanotechnology publications including peer reviewed articles, reviews, and other types of reports related to the use of nanotechnology in biomedicine
