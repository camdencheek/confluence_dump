Sample composition records information associated with the way a sample is made, especially in terms of its different parts, its constituents. Composition for a sample in caNanoLab consists of information categorized by nanomaterial entity, functionalizing entity, and chemical association(s). You can also add files relevant to the sample composition or derivation of its data.
