During a caNanoLab workflow, you can identify a protocol used in creating or annotating a sample. A protocol provides clear and detailed documentation about the precise actions taken in any procedure that might be part of an experiment. For example, a protocol could describe the steps a laboratory used for characterizing samples. There are different type of protocols, such as Physical, In Vitro, and In Vivo.With every protocol object you create in caNanoLab, you can define its visibility, in other words, its access to other users of caNanoLab. For more information about visibility options, refer to the tables corresponding to each characterization type in
