        apoptosis
      </td>
      <td>
        An active process of selective destruction of differentiated cells in multicellular organisms, apoptosis is one of two mechanisms by which cell death occurs (the other being necrosis, a pathological process). Important in ontogenesis, tumorigenesis, tissue turnover, lymphocyte selection and function, hormone-induced atrophy, etc., it serves as a balance to mitosis in regulating the size of animal tissues and in mediating pathologic processes associated with tumor growth. Apoptosis is responsible for physiological deletion of cells and appears to be intrinsically programmed. It is characterized by distinctive morphologic changes in the nucleus and cytoplasm, including chromatin cleavage at regularly spaced sites and endonucleolytic cleavage of genomic DNA (DNA fragmentation) at internucleosomal sites.

        complement activation
      </td>
      <td>
        The complement system consists of more than 30 proteins engaged in host defense. It provides both an independent immune system capable of attacking microbes as well as other foreign material and an adjunct to the antibody system. Once activated, the complement system fires in a cascade-like fashion in which one component activates the next. Both swift and powerful, millions of complement components can deposit on an invading microbe within only a few minutes. Such a potent system requires strict regulation to avoid host injury. Membrane cofactor protein (MCP) is one critical regulator aimed at controlling inadvertent complement activation on host cells and nearly every cell examined expresses MCP on its cell membrane.

These polymers have desirable pharmacokinetic properties and a polyvalent array of surface groups that make them potential drug delivery vesicles.

        A quantum dot is a nanometer-sized semiconductor particle, made of cadmium selenide (CdSe), cadmium sulfide (CdS) or cadmium telluride (CdTe) with an inert polymer coating. The semiconductor material used for the core is chosen based upon the emission wavelength range being targeted: CdS for UV-blue, CdSe for the bulk of the visible spectrum, and CdTe for far red and near-infrared. The size of the particle determines the exact color of a given quantum dot. The polymer coating protects cells from cadmium toxicity but also facilitates the attachment of a variety of targeting molecules, including monoclonal antibodies directed to tumor-specific biomarkers.

Because it is possible for some electron transitions to be of higher energy than nuclear transition, there is an overlap between low energy gamma rays and high energy X-rays. Gamma rays are considered to be electromagnetic radiation with wavelengths of 1 nanometer or shorter while x-rays are between approximately.01 nanometers and 200 nanometers.
