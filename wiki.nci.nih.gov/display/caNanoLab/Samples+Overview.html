A sample is a formulation of a base nanoparticle platform and any additional components that contribute to the function(s) of the nanoparticle. A sample can also be a control used in comparative analysis. These samples are used in biomedical applications in which they serve as drug carriers or imaging agents. Samples can be targeting agents, such as antibodies, drugs, imaging agents, and reporters or the nanoparticles themselves to which they are attached at the surface.Click theÂ Samples menu, and from Manage Samples you can perform the following functions.
