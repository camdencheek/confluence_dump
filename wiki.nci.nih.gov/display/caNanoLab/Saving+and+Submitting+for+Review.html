Making an item publicOnce you log into caNanoLab, you can create and save samples, publications, and protocols to caNanoLab and modify access to an item. If you are a curator, you can also make the saved item publicly-accessible. If you are not a curator, you must submit the item to a curator for review and approval for public release.
