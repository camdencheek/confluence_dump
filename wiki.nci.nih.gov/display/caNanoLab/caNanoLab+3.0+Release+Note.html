        New Client: Groups: When Expanding a Collaboration Group, Samples listed are not hyperlinked. When the end user selects Groups &gt; Manage Collaboration Groups, they can view the Samples assigned to a collaboration group by clicking on the Collaboration Group Name to expand. Once expanded, the column “Sample Name” lists all the samples assigned to the Collaboration Group. The issue was that the Sample Names were not hyperlinked so the end user can navigate directly to the Sample to view. This patch release made the Sample Names hyperlinked.
