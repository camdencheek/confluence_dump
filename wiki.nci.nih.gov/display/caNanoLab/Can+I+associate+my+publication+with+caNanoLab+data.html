caNanoLab supports the submission of publication information and the association of caNanoLab data with publications.  To submit publication information, complete the web-based submit publication form. If the publication is available in PubMed, provide the PubMed ID and caNanoLab will auto-populate the publication information. When submitting publication information, select the caNanoLab samples associated with the publication. This will associate the publication with caNanoLab data available for the sample.In addition to associating samples with publication information stored in the the caNanoLab Data Portal, caNanoLab has established a direct reciprocal link between datasets and associated research articles published by Elsevier. When a user performs an Elsevier search, caNanoLab now returns a caNanoLab logo if the publication has linked samples in the caNanoLab database. If not, caNanoLab sends a transparent one pixel image.The following is the URL format that searches caNanoLab for a DOI ID.
https://cananolab.cancer.gov/caNanoLab/views/publicationSampleImage.html?type=DOI&amp;id=ADDID

For example:
https://cananolab.cancer.gov/caNanoLab/views/publicationSampleImage.html?type=DOI&amp;id=11.1111/z.zz.9999.99.999

The current list of Elsevier journals that offer reciprocal linking as well as the future list are available on the
