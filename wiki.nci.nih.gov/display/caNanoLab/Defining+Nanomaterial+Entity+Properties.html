        Generations are shells layered on the core of a dendrimer. Dendrimers consist of layers of chemical shells built on a core module. Each shell consists of two chemicals in the same order (A-B) and each shell is called a generation. The generations are labeled in decimal to illustrate the shell layering/consistency. For example, Generation 2.5 (G2.5) = 1 shell of A-B (1), surrounded by a second shell of A-B (2), topped off with only one chemical A within the shell (.5). As such, the layering structure would be (A-B, A-B, A) = 2.5.
