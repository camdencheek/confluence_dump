caNanoLab allows researchers to submit and retrieve information on nanoparticles and associated information including:
<ul>
  <li>
    The composition of the particle including nanoparticle entities (e.g. dendrimers, carbon nanotubes, quantum dots, etc.), functionalizing entities (therapeutic, targeting, and diagnostics entities), and chemical associations (chemical associations, attachments, or encapsulations between nanoparticle entities or functionalizing entities).
  </li>
  <li>
    Physical characterizations performed on a nanoparticle including size, molecular weight, shape, purity, etc.
  </li>
  <li>
    In vitro characterizations performed on a nanoparticle including cytotoxicity, immunotoxicity, and general toxicity characterization results.
  </li>
  <li>
    Protocols for characterizations performed on nanoparticles or general nanotechnology protocols from biomedical nanotechnology studies.
  </li>
  <li>
    Publications from biomedical nanotechnology studies.
  </li>
</ul>
caNanoLab provides secure access to data and requires authentication and authorization for access to non-public data.
