ARRANGING INFORMATIONAL INTERVIEWSThank you for your patience as we try out this new aspect of our program. Hopefully, you have been in contact with either GSRP Admin (to make e-intros yourself) or NCI investigators to begin arranging your schedules.

  Interviewing Tips with Scott Morgan (2020)
</a>
There have a been a number of programmatic changes that some of the investigators may not be aware of. We want to do our best to alleviate as much confusion as possible. As such, I want you to be aware of how this impacts you.
<ul>
  <li>
    REMOVAL OF THE POSTER SESSION This frees up an entire day for you to solely conduct interviews and participate in the provided GSRP sessions. However, this will also mean that there isn&#39;t a neutral space to speak with members of the respective research groups. You may want to have a longer meetings that allow you to meet with additional people within the research group, and if possible go for lunch or coffee.
    <ul>
      <li>
        This also means that there no longer a uniform schedule for transporting candidates, as everyone&#39;s schedule will be different. But don&#39;t worry, we will make sure that you can get back and forth. There are shuttles between the campuses, and if there are people traveling in groups, our logistics teams can arrange a ride for you.

    EXTENSION OF ELIGIBILITY In previous years, you had be within 12 months of defending your dissertation. As such, investigators who participated in the program used it as a direct hiring mechanism. If you will be defending in 12+ months, please be sure to communicate this to the investigators, as the conversation may look at little different.
    <ul>
      <li>
        Be sure to ask questions regarding their expectations in a postdoc and whether they have any helpful tips

    TEMPORARY WEBSITE While investigators do have an interim website in which they can access your application, they are unable to upload projects. Additionally, we previously required three letters of recommendation, and this year we only asked for one. If you introduce yourself to an investigator who does not have access to the site, please have them contact us at
    <a href="mailto:ncigsrp@mail.nih.gov" rel="nofollow">
      ncigsrp@mail.nih.gov
    </a>
    and we can provide access.
  </li>
</ul>
We encourage you to have interviews both virtually and on-site during the event. It is also possible that interviews may take place following the conference. Be sure to keep an eye on your email and schedule accordingly. To plan for in-person interviews, be sure to give yourself up to 30 minutes between meetings so that you can get across campus in a timely fashion.
