</h2>
Subscribe to the
<a href="https://list.nih.gov/archives/nes-users-l.html" rel="nofollow">
  NES-USERS-L@LIST.NIH.GOV mailing list
</a>
for announcements of new releases, changes to the services, etc. You can also post to this list with any questions you may have about accessing the services. This list is intended to be fully interactive and not just for announcements from the CTRP/COPPA team - we encourage all users to ask questions and respond to anyone else&#39;s questions freely.
<h2 id="Accessingservices-Legacyservice/End-of-lifesupportpolicy">
  Legacy service/End-of-life support policy
</h2>
Three versions of NCI Enterprise services are supported at any point of time - the most recent version and the previous two versions. As new versions are released, the oldest version will be retired and will no longer be accessible; although CTRP/NES development is fast-paced, it is intended that clients will have to upgrade no more than once a year. For example, as of August 2010, we support NES 3.2, as well as NES 3.1 and 3.0. NES 3.0 has reached the end-of-life (EOL) status and will be retired upon the release of NES 3.3 (late fall/early winter 2010); all users of NES 3.0 are encouraged to upgrade to 3.2 as soon as possible.
<h2 id="Accessingservices-Backgroundinformation">
  Background information
</h2>
The PO/PA grid services are ISO 21090 compliant. To construct valid XML messages to send to the services, you should be familiar with the
<a href="https://wiki.nci.nih.gov/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=25004394" rel="nofollow">
  ISO 21090 Published Standard
</a>
(login required). Also read the 21090 PIM (platform independent model) specification, as well as the PO and PA service PIMs available at
<a href="https://ncisvn.nci.nih.gov/svn/coppa/trunk/documents/analysis_and_design/service_specifications/" rel="nofollow">
  https://ncisvn.nci.nih.gov/svn/coppa/trunk/documents/analysis_and_design/service_specifications/
</a>
. A list of CTRP/COPPA roots to be used with ISO 21090 IIs can be found

<h2 id="Accessingservices-ConsumingSecureServices">
  Consuming Secure Services
</h2>
All PA services are secure (meaning authentication is required), and v3.1 and 3.2 of the PO services are secure.
<h3 id="Accessingservices-Obtaininganauthorizedgridaccount">
  Obtaining an authorized grid account
</h3>
To access secure grid services (both PO and PA services), you&#39;ll need an authorized grid account on the appropriate grid. If you intend to use the Integration tiers or a local deployment inside the NIH firewall, you should use the Stage Grid; for the Demo tier and local deployments outside the firewall, you should use the Training Grid.  You can create an account using the caGrid Portal (
<a href="http://portal.training.cagrid.org/" rel="nofollow">
  training Portal
</a>
 or
<a href="http://cagrid-portal-stage.nci.nih.gov/" rel="nofollow">
  stage Portal
</a>
) or using GAARDS-UI (see instructions for
<a href="http://cagrid.org/display/downloads/caGrid+1.3+Installation+Quick+Start" rel="nofollow">
  caGrid 1.3 software installation
</a>
and
<a href="http://cagrid.org/display/cagrid13tutorials/Create+User+Account" rel="nofollow">
  creating an account
</a>
).Record your grid credential (aka Grid Identity) for later use. An example for the training grid is:
/O=caBIG/OU=caGrid/OU=Training/OU=Dorian/CN=coppagridtest

An example for the stage grid is:
/O=caBIG/OU=caGrid/OU=Stage LOA1/OU=Dorian/CN=coppagridtest

If you&#39;re using the Integration tier, you can use the existing coppagridtest account (password is Coppa#12345).  If you&#39;re using the Stage grid or would like to have your own account added to the integration tier, please email
<a href="mailto:NES-USERS-L@LIST.NIH.GOV" rel="nofollow">
  NES-USERS-L@LIST.NIH.GOV
</a>
with the grid identity to be added.  If you&#39;re using your own local installations of PO/PA, see
<a href="https://wiki.nci.nih.gov/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=19792500" rel="nofollow">
  Add your own Grid Identity to PO and/or PA
</a>
.
<h3 id="Accessingservices-JavaHOW-TO">
  Java HOW-TO
</h3>
Each day before you start using the services, you&#39;ll need to Login to Dorian using the GAARDS UI to extend your local grid identity certificates. They are valid for no more than 12 hours.To access the services using java clients, you may want to start with our sample Introduced-generated clients - instructions for running these clients via ant are available.  IDs and search terms are hard-coded in those clients, so you&#39;ll need to change them and recompile as needed.  You can call into those clients from your own code; we have a client package prepared for the Trial Registration Serviceto make it easier for you, and client packages for the rest of the services will be available soon.
<h3 id="Accessingservices-SoapUIHOW-TO">
  SoapUI HOW-TO
</h3>
SoapUI is a web service testing tool that allows for creating SOAP messages and using them to invoke web service end points.  This tool can be convenient if you would like to call services without any coding, such as in QA.  Please see
<a href="https://wiki.nci.nih.gov/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=29563436" rel="nofollow">
  these instructions
</a>
for how to add grid credentials to SoapUI in order to call secure services.
<h2 id="Accessingservices-ConsumingUnsecuredServices">
  Consuming Unsecured Services
</h2>
Unsecure Services were available prior to v3.1 of PO &amp; PA and will be retired when v3.3 is released.You can access the unsecured services (both PO and PA services) via java the same way you would access the secured services (see above), skipping the steps that involve obtaining grid credentials.  You can also use SoapUI without going through the security steps described above.
<h2 id="Accessingservices-POServices">
  PO Services
</h2>
The PO services on the Integration tier are only available from within the NIH firewall, while the services on the Demo tier are accessible outside the firewall.Grid service version numbers are separate from web application version numbers, so the release of PO 3.5 (for example) does not imply a corresponding 3.5 release of the grid services. The next version of the grid services to be released will be 3.4, regardless of the version the PO web application is on at the time.

3.1 and 3.2 services require https and grid credentials, 3.0 services can be accessed via plain http without grid credentials
