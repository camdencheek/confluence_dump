The overall potential scope of the Subject Accrual Service is to enable users to report and query subject accrual information for any NCI-supported clinical trial.The following functions are out of scope for this version:
<ul>
  <li>
    Subject Registration. Registration is provided by the existing subject registration service. Additionally, the long term plan includes functionality that will enable the Subject Registration service to provide subject accrual data for any studies that use the Subject Registration service. However, because not all NCI funded studies will use the Subject Registration service, the Subject Accrual service will continue to act as a collection mechanism for subject accrual data.
  </li>
  <li>
    Submission based on study or study site status. This restriction will not be implemented at this time in order to reduce any barriers to entering subject accrual data into the Subject Accrual service. In the future, restrictions based on study and study site status will be implemented.
  </li>
  <li>
    Support for any other service or application beyond the Trial Reporting Program (CTRP). The long term scope for the subject accrual service includes the collection of subject demographic data in support of any other service or application within the NCI. The initial scope focuses on the subject demographic data required to support the Clinical Trial Reporting Program (CTRP). As such, the data elements defined and collected are based on the CTRP requirements. The overall potential scope of the Subject Accrual Service is to allow the reporting and querying of subject accrual information for any CTRP registered interventional studies.
