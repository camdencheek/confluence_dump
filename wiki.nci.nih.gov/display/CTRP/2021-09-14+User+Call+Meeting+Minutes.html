  Discussion/Minutes
</h2>
NCI Funded Designation
<ul>
  <li>
    For the NCI Funded change for indirect and direct funding, are these changes only going forward or will they be retroactive?
    <ul>
      <li>
        CTRP has retroactively added the indirect/direct funding for trials already in the system.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    Can you reiterate the reason for registering studies that have no direct or indirect NCI funding?
    <ul>
      <li>
        NCI’s expectation is that all studies at a Cancer Center will have at least indirect funding.  The option to support No NCI Funding is for other trials that may be added into CTRP in support of expanded cancer clinical trial search requirements, e.g., Veterans Affairs (VA) cancer clinical trials.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    Will NCI funded be added to DT4 or is this just CTRP data being collected for other purposes?
    <ul>
      <li>
        There is no current expectation to include a data element for NCI Funded on the DT4 report.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
“Other” Trials, e.g., Pragmatic Studies, Non-Consenting
<ul>
  <li>
    What level of accrual reporting would these &#34;Other&#34; trials (aka Pragmatic) require? Full or Partial?
    <ul>
      <li>
        From a technical perspective, CTRP can collect Summary, Partial Subject, or Subject level accrual for these studies.  Defining the type of accrual would be on a case-by-case basis, please reach out to CTRO (
        <a href="mailto:NCICTRO@mail.nih.gov" rel="nofollow">
          NCICTRO@mail.nih.gov
        </a>
        ) for assistance with specific trials.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
Observational Studies in CTRP
<ul>
  <li>
    Is there a reason we would submit studies which closed to accrual prior to 2020?
    <ul>
      <li>
        Yes, the expectation is to include any trial(s) open to accrual as of or after 01/01/2018.  Other cancer centers may have these trials open on an NCI FY2022 (and/or future) DT4 report.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    For Observational industry studies where the sponsor is not planning to register in
    <a href="http://ClinicalTrials.gov" rel="nofollow">
      ClinicalTrials.gov
    </a>
    , there is a concern about sharing the protocol which is not technically &#34;owned&#34; by the institution.  Do you have any work around for this?
    <ul>
      <li>
        Yes, please reach out to CTRO (
        <a href="mailto:NCICTRO@mail.nih.gov" rel="nofollow">
          NCICTRO@mail.nih.gov
        </a>
        ) for assistance with these trials.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    Just to confirm, Observational accruals can be submitted annually and will not require to be reported on quarterly?
    <ul>
      <li>
        Correct, the Lead Organization reports cumulative accrual on at least an annual basis as determined by their CCSG submission schedule.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    Can accrual for Observational studies be updated in bulk (with a minimal data set)? Particularly for those which are closed to accrual.
    <ul>
      <li>
        Batch accrual loading is available, please contact the CTRO (
        <a href="mailto:NCICTRO@mail.nih.gov" rel="nofollow">
          NCICTRO@mail.nih.gov
        </a>
        ) to confirm any direct parameters.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    Just to confirm, cumulative accrual can be submitted for Observational studies instead of Subject-level accrual?
    <ul>
      <li>
        Correct, however, only one type of accrual can be reported.  If the Lead Organization is reporting Summary, Partial Subject, or Subject level accrual, that accrual will be continued throughout all accrual reported.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    Is CTRP still in the process of reaching out to Cancer Centers regarding reconciliation observational studies?
    <ul>
      <li>
        Yes, Cancer Centers will be contacted at least 4-6 weeks prior to their next non-competing application.  If any additional questions arise, please reach out to the CTRO (
        <a href="mailto:NCICTRO@mail.nih.gov" rel="nofollow">
          NCICTRO@mail.nih.gov
        </a>
        ) proactively to request a meeting/ask questions.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
National Accrual
<ul>
  <li>
    Are there plans to indicate which National trials report screening accruals vs. intervention accruals?
    <ul>
      <li>
        If the “Primary Purpose” is “Screening”, all patients counted on the DT4 report are screened patients.  If the “Primary Purpose” is “Treatment”, all patients counted on the DT4 report should be patients registered on the “Interventional” step of the trial.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
Manage DT4 Elements
<ul>
  <li>
    Is there a plan to align the data elements that we have to manually update in the &#34;Manage DT4 Information&#34; with data we are already entering when we register a trial?  A lot of duplicate entry is necessary. It is very time consuming.
    <ul>
      <li>
        The CTRP team has been reviewing this alignment and considering various options for how to further streamline potentially in the future.  Please note that there are different levels of data elements represented and managed when a trial is registered (e.g., Overall-trial level) versus “Manage DT4 Information” (e.g., Cancer Center-level) which need to be managed as separate data.
