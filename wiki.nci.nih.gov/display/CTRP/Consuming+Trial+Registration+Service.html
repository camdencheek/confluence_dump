  Service Description
</h1>
The Trial Registration Service provides a standardized set of interfaces for registering Trials with NCI&#39;s Clinical Trials Reporting Program (CTRP). There are two main categories of clinical trials that can be registered with CTRP - NCI-supported trials (also referred to as Complete trials) and Industry-led (referred to as Abbreviated Trials).

to learn more about NCI&#39;s CTRP.   The Trial registration service&#39;s semantic representation leverages the computable structured representation of a Study Protocol as defined by the BRIDG model and implemented in COPPA services as a BRIDG based Information model in support of computable semantic interoperability.
