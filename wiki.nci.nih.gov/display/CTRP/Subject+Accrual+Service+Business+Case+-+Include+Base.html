The Subject Accrual Service meets the needs of the clinical research community by providing a centralized, authoritative service for reporting the current status of subject accrual information for ongoing clinical studies. In addition to the inherent value of collecting this information in a centralized and standardized manner, reporting subject accrual information supports a key goal of the Clinical Trials Working Group to develop a &#34;shared foundation of comprehensive, up-to-date information about the status of cancer trials.&#34; By creating a service for the contribution of subject accrual information, the NCI is able to more readily identify gaps in clinical research and duplicative studies, and facilitate effective clinical trial prioritization.
