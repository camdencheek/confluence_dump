The Subject Accrual Service provides a set of interfaces for reporting information related to subjects who have been accrued to a clinical study, and to enable other applications, services, and users to query this information. Once a study has been successfully initiated, reports containing information about accrued subjects provide insight into the progress of the study and the rate at which subjects are volunteering for a particular study. The Subject Accrual Service provides an authoritative source for up-to-date information on the number and types of subjects accrued to a particular clinical study.
