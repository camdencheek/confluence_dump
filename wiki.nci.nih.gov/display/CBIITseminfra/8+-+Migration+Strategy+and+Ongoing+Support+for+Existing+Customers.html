Current Working Draft


This section will describe the Semantic Infrastructure 2.0 Roadmap Team&#39;s recommendation for a migration strategy from current infrastructure to the new infrastructure. The Semantic Infrastructure team in concert with other CBIIT teams is working on prototyping processes and tools to support migration. The working plan is that the existing infrastructure will be used until the new infrastructure is available. CBIIT believes there will be a one time migration of existing content from existing infrastructure (that is, the caDSR) to the new infrastructure. The new infrastructure is planned to support existing users of the current infrastructure, including seamless transition for existing applications calling the data service API of the current infrastructure. The prototyping effort through March 2011 will test these assumptions and arrive at a more concrete proposal based on the migration prototyping work.
