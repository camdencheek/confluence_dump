Section 6 &gt; Tools for Semantic Infrastructure 2.0 &gt; Semantic Infrastructure Services and Interactions November 22 version
&#34;The artifact authoring part describes &#34;register the object identifier with its metadata&#34; and &#34;link artifacts to service specifications&#34;. Additionally, the artifact analysis part describes &#34;execute semantic queries for search and analysis&#34;. I assume these semantic queries work on the above-mentioned metadata and service specifications?


Resolution: Yes. Raghu Chintalapati

The latter service specifications are being authored in the &#34;Administer Services and Specifications&#34; as well as the so-called service metadata. Is the meta-data in &#34;register the object identifier with its metadata&#34; this service data, if not, where is this metadata being authored?


Resolution: The metadata is either derived from the artifacts (if they are computable) or specified by the user using a set of API&#39;s/interfaces. Raghu Chintalapati

&#34;Link the artifacts to the service specification&#34; is appearing 2 times, once in the &#34;Artifact authoring&#34; and once in the &#34;Administer services and specifications&#34;. Is this intentionally a bi- directional activity (can be done from both sides)? Which again brings up the service registry in some form, is this different from the artifact registry?


Resolution: The interfaces are the same but the functionality is available from one place. SI provides is a design time repository of service specifications and all the artifacts that make up a specification. The words ECCF registry, design time service registry and artifact registry are all used interchangeably. Raghu Chintalapati

Also the &#34;execute semantic queries for search and analysis&#34; appears both in &#34;Artifact Analysis&#34; and in &#34;Analyze Services&#34;. The relation between artifacts and services is not clear.


Resolution: It implies that search and analysis can be performed against both services and artifacts. Services specification is usually an aggregation of artifacts. SI is expected to support individual artifacts as well, like form definitions, etc. Raghu Chintalapati

Many things are unclear. For example, &#34;allow governance to set the status of a specification and promote&#34;. What can be the status of a specification and its promotions? Raghu Chintalapati


Resolution: The status of a specification can be draft, new, production, etc. The status allows the service owners to track the status of his/her specification as it goes through the governance lifecycle.

There is a task for discovery &#34;Discovery services&#34; in the Search and Access Services but no task for composition/orchestration even though this is in the functional requirements.


Resolution: Composition/Orchestration rely heavily on discovery of the right services. The SI team is assessing the feasibility of automated and semi-automated composition and orchestration. Raghu Chintalapati

The Knowledge Based Systems Support Tools part is just not OK. What is the difference between Knowledge Representation Definition and Knowledge Base Model Definition, why have a Rule Pattern Definition but no Description Logic Knowledge Base definition (or is this the Domain Model Development?), what is the difference between Rule Pattern Definition and Rule Generation tooling?


Resolution:

Knowledge Representation Definition refers to the reference model used as the overall model for the knowledge base, your reference information model. The Knowledge Base Model Definition refers to the instance model for your actual knowledge base, which is likely a subset of the Knowledge Representation Definition.

The Knowledge Base Model Definition is the Description Logic (DL) Knowledge Base definition.

The Rule Pattern Definition is the transform between a DL pattern and another (usually first order logic) rule language. The Rule Generation Tooling is the tooling to accomplish the conversion of the DL pattern to the rule pattern.
