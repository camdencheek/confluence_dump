Current Working Draft


This section will provide information about interim development for Semantic Infrastructure 2.0, based on results from the
<a href="https://wiki.nci.nih.gov/x/WAwSAg" rel="nofollow">
  Migration Protoyping project
</a>
.

The migration strategy for Semantic Infrastructure includes:
<ul>
  <li>
    Support for current users of CDEs
  </li>
  <li>
    Transforming a set of CDEs to the new Semantic Infrastructure representation
    <ul>
      <li>
        Determining the process for the transformation
      </li>
      <li>
        Determining how many CDEs need to be transformed, including usage and re-use
      </li>
      <li>
        Determining whether parts of process can be automated
      </li>
      <li>
        Determining the level of effort
      </li>
      <li>
        Determining what will the user experience will be, that is, what interfaces community members will use
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
