Current Working Draft


Forms usually refer to clinical documents which represent information about a clinical activity. A forms document contains the specific information gained during that clinical activity and supports the broader definitions of a document. Documents can be transformed into human readable forms, and be transferred or transmitted electronically for use across different systems.

Forms tooling includes capabilities for:
<ul>
  <li>
    Defining form templates. Form definitions are usually models and form definition can be considered a specific type of modeling.
  </li>
  <li>
    Ability to leverage existing models and reusable segments for defining these forms and to reuse and leverage predefined templates.
  </li>
  <li>
    Ability to bind to ISO 21090 datatypes and terminology in the form of value sets to form controls.
  </li>
  <li>
    A user friendly interface that hides the complexity of the underlying semantics.
  </li>
  <li>
    Ability to transform forms definitions into both electronic and other user friendly representations, for data entry. Note that data is not captured by the semantic infrastructure.
  </li>
  <li>
    Ability to define skip patterns and validate form definitions.
  </li>
  <li>
    Ability to define layout and display options.
  </li>
  <li>
    Support for both Operational Data Model (ODM) and Clinical Document Architecture (CDA) based forms models.
  </li>
</ul>
