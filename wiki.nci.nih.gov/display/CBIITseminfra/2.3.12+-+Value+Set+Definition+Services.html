The CTS 2 specification uses term &#34;Value Set&#34; which is basically the LexEVS implementation of &#34;Value Set Definition.&#34; Though CTS 2 implementation functions use term &#34;Value Set&#34; internally, the LexEVS Value Set Definition Services are used. CTS 2 specification contains several Value Set specific profiles. All of these functions can be called using CTS 2 interface. For more information refer to
