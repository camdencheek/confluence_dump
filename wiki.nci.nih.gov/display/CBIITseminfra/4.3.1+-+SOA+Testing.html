Testing for SOA combines the typical challenges of software testing and certification with the additional needs of accommodating the distributed nature of the resources, the greater access of a more unbounded consumer population, and the desired flexibility to create new solutions from existing components over which the solution developer has little if any control. The purpose of testing is to demonstrate a required level of reliability, correctness, and effectiveness that enable prospective consumers to have adequate confidence in using a service. Adequacy is defined by the consumer based on the consumer&#39;s needs and context of use. Absolute correctness and completeness cannot be proven by testing; however, for SOA, it is critical for the prospective consumer to know what testing has been performed, how it has been performed, and what were the results.

The  architectural implications on the Semantic Infrastructure  include:
<ul>
  <li>
    The distributed, boundary-less nature of the SOA ecosystem makes it infeasible to create and maintain a single mock of the entire ecosystem to support testing activities.
  </li>
  <li>
    A standard suite of monitoring services needs to be defined, developed, and maintained. This should be done in a manner consistent with the evolving nature of the ecosystem.
  </li>
  <li>
    Services should provide interfaces that support access in a test mode.
  </li>
  <li>
    Testing resources must be described and their descriptions must be catalogued in a manner that enables their discovery and access.
  </li>
  <li>
    Guidelines for testing and ecosystem access need to be established and the ecosystem must be able to enforce those guidelines asserted as policies.
  </li>
  <li>
    Services should be available to support automated testing and regression testing.
  </li>
  <li>
    Services should be available to facilitate updating service description by anyone who has performed testing of a service.
  </li>
</ul>
