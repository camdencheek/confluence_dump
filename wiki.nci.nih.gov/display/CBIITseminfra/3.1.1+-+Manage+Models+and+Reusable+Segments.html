  Capabilities
</h6>
The form builder applications must be able to query an ECCF registry service and return a form template that defines the overall type of form being designed. Examples of the forms could be procedure notes, discharge summary notes, or medication administration notes. Forms may also be related to the capture of data from a clinical trial or a basic science experiment. Each of these types of forms would be identified by its own object identifier and the query would involve the ability to provide either a name of the form or an object identifier as parameters for the query.

Forms are made up of sections which may be identified by template identifiers or by a common message element type identifier. The service will support any identifier and will enable a federated query across several repositories both in and outside of the ECCF. Examples of these would be a template repository hosted by HL7 or by another organization with a node on the caGRID.
