The IRI resolution service is a generic service and, as such, is not embedded in the rest of the CTS2 service specification. Its purpose is to map resource IRIs of various forms to their canonical equivalent.

The determination of what constitutes a “canonical” IRI is dependent on the use context and the service provider.
