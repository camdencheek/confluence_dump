  Overall Process and Request for Community Input
</h3>
In order to capitalize on new informatics technologies and changing community needs, we are asking for your collaboration in the development of a roadmap for creating the Semantic Infrastructure 2.0, the next generation of caBIG® Semantic Infrastructure. As core stakeholders of caBIG® tools and technologies, your input is essential in guiding the development of expanded capabilities to support the rapidly evolving needs of the caBIG® community.

Building on a combination of current caBIG® semantic infrastructure technology, technology advances that have occurred over the past several years, and Lessons Learned from our collective experiences with the current Semantic Infrastructure including caDSR and EVS, the vision for Semantic Infrastructure 2.0 is to provide enhanced capabilities in the context of three overarching requirements:
<ul>
  <li>
    Lower barriers to entry for all stakeholders -- scientists, clinicians, technologists, and informaticists -- creating a working environment in which &#34;easy things are easy to do,&#34;
  </li>
  <li>
    Leverage the increasingly mature collection of publicly-available open source infrastructure and the expanding trends in user friendly platforms, and
  </li>
  <li>
    Continue to provide support and migration strategies for users of the legacy Semantic Infrastructure.
  </li>
</ul>
Please review this working draft and give us your input regarding the scope of the Semantic Infrastructure 2.0, specific capabilities that you see as essential for the success of the Semantic Infrastructure 2.0, or suggestions for improvement of the document. The Semantic Infrastructure 2.0 project team will review and post the disposition of all input received.

The Semantic Infrastructure 2.0 team will publish, at approximately every-two-weeks intervals, ongoing evolutions of the document to reflect substantive content changes as a result of both team input and community input. Each version will be publicly available for comment. The final version of the Semantic Infrastructure 2.0 Roadmap will be published by the end of September, 2010.

Thank you in advance for your contributions and ongoing engagement as we collaboratively develop the capabilities that will define the Semantic Infrastructure 2.0. This opportunity to collaborate and share your expertise will ensure that we can deliver the best possible product to the broad spectrum of users in the caBIG® community.

  Goals and Objectives for the Semantic Infrastructure 2.0 Roadmap
</h3>
The purpose of this document is to define the basic requirements for the next generation – that is,  Version 2.0 – of caBIG®-CBIIT Semantic Infrastructure.

&#34;Semantic Infrastructure&#34; is defined as including the collective set of strategies, technologies, and tools that support the publishing and processing of all aspects of data, metadata, terminology, and value set content related to the support for both design-time and run-time computable semantic interoperability (CSI).

Thus it is assumed that Semantic Infrastructure 2.0 subsumes the scope of the current caBIG®-CBIIT semantic infrastructure including caDSR and EVS. In particular, the Semantic Infrastructure 2.0 is expected to support relevant aspects of both informational (&#34;static&#34;) and behavioral (&#34;dynamic&#34;) metadata in addition to historical terminology and value-set management functions.

It is especially important to note that the support for informational, behavioral, and terminology and value-set management will be integrated with the caGrid 2.0 infrastructure to allow for both design-time and run-time support for CSI at the level of individual services deployed on caGrid 2.0.

Critical aspects of the overarching framework for integration of the Semantic Infrastructure 2.0 with the caGrid 2.0 technical infrastructure are expected to emerge during evolution of both this document and the caGrid 2.0 Roadmap. Ultimately these aspects will be harmonized and unified in a single technical approach. The integration will be significantly deeper than the current integration as supported by the Global Model Exchange (GME).

The Semantic Infrastructure 2.0 Roadmap is being developed in a transparent, collaborative process with the caBIG® community to ensure that the relevant requirements needed to provide the planned design- and run-time support for informational and behavioral semantics integrated with the caGrid 2.0 infrastructure are appropriately surfaced and defined. The overarching enterprise-level requirement for both the Semantic Infrastructure and caGrid 2.0 projects is to provide comprehensive support for the information discovery and integration, and functional coordination requirements, that will meet the evolving needs of the scientists, clinicians, patients and other stakeholders who collectively define the caBIG® community.

It should be emphasized that although the Semantic Infrastructure 2.0 and caGrid 2.0 roadmaps are being developed by separate project teams, it is the overarching goal and commitment of CBIIT that the two efforts ultimately be deeply integrated and merged into a single caBIG® 2.0 semantically-aware Service-Oriented Architecture and run-time platform, that is, caGrid 2.0.

Thus, both the Semantic Infrastructure 2.0 and caGrid 2.0 roadmap projects share the same overarching goals:
<ul>
  <li>
    Reduce the barrier to entry for all users of the Semantic Infrastructure 2.0 and caGrid 2.0
  </li>
  <li>
    Provide a &#34;linear value proposition,&#34; that is, make &#34;easy things easy to do while hard things will require more effort.&#34; This means providing tools and solutions that can be used and assembled by multiple stakeholders from multiple perspectives as opposed to the current high-level of effort required to &#34;get on the Grid,&#34; a effort which has, in fact, proven to be a barrier to participation for many stakeholders in the caBIG® community.
  </li>
  <li>
    Provide support for legacy users and their data.
  </li>
  <li>
    Provide an environment that utilizes informatics standards when appropriate to enable broad-based intra- and inter-community interoperability, but does not necessarily enforce standards when they are not needed due to considerations of limited scope or minimal interoperability requirements.
  </li>
</ul>
The Semantic Infrastructure 2.0 Roadmap document will form the basis for subsequent requests for proposals that will result in development work that will realize the goals defined by the roadmap. In particular, the Semantic Infrastructure 2.0 project is expected to produce both the roadmap document in close collaboration with the caBIG® community, and to develop a comprehensive set of prototype tools. These tools will inform follow-on development work in terms of:
<ul>
  <li>
    Definition and design and run-time support for informational and behavioral metadata
  </li>
  <li>
    Appropriate adoption of emerging Semantic Web tools and technologies
  </li>
  <li>
    Support for migration of legacy semantic infrastructure data and metadata
  </li>
  <li>
    Integration strategies and tooling requirements for interoperability with non-CBIIT semantic representational strategies and infrastructures
  </li>
</ul>
Thus readers of the Semantic Infrastructure 2.0 Roadmap should view it as a &#34;Scope and Vision&#34; document executed as part of a formal &#34;Semantic Infrastructure 2.0 Inception Phase.&#34; Thus, future versions of the roadmap document can be expected to provide a concrete overview of topics including, but not necessarily limited to, the following:
<ul>
  <li>
    Major risk factors (including but not limited to complexity, tooling, and scalability) that must be managed or mitigated to enable the Semantic Infrastructure 2.0 project to succeed
  </li>
  <li>
    Description of prototyping activities
  </li>
  <li>
    Identification of various &#34;build versus buy&#34; options for specific components of the Semantic Infrastructure 2.0
  </li>
</ul>
The open and transparent framework in which the Semantic Infrastructure 2.0 project is being executed is specifically designed to encourage and integrate caBIG® community input into the project&#39;s overall content. This includes integrating caBIG® stakeholder community input into the specifics of the several bulleted items in the preceding paragraphs.

The overarching philosophy behind the content of the Semantic Infrastructure 2.0 Roadmap is that the technologies and approaches described are a direct result of the need to support the requirements of the scientists, clinicians, trialists, patients, and other stakeholders that comprise the caBIG® stakeholder community. Thus the following two sections of this roadmap provide a working profile of the stakeholders and the working set of associated use cases and storyboards that are collectively being used to define the overarching, enterprise-level requirements for the Semantic Infrastructure 2.0 technologies and tools.

The Semantic Infrastructure 2.0 Roadmap is being collectively authored by a team with extensive knowledge of the legacy caBIG® semantic infrastructure and the associated lessons learned from its use, as well as the realities of &#34;what works and what doesn&#39;t&#34; in the technology world as it moves to &#34;Web 2.0&#34; and &#34;the semantic web.&#34; As described in the published process framework for the development of the Semantic Infrastructure 2.0 Roadmap, the goal of the project is to combine the perspectives and inputs of the Semantic Infrastructure 2.0 team of experts with caBIG® community input to provide the content for a roadmap that will guide the development of the next generation of caBIG® semantic infrastructure.

  Support for legacy semantics as currently represented in caDSR via ISO 11179
</h3>
It is critical that the semantics currently represented in caDSR and EVS be supported in the Semantic Infrastructure 2.0. However, it is equally important that both current and future caBIG® stakeholders understand as users of the Semantic Infrastructure 2.0, that the underlying representation of legacy semantics will be markedly different in the Semantic Infrastructure 2.0 compared to the legacy semantic infrastructure. One of the primary responsibilities of the Semantic Infrastructure 2.0 Roadmap is to specifically identify and describe prototypes for strategies and tools which will be required to:
<ul>
  <li>
    Migrate existing semantic content into the Semantic Infrastructure 2.0
  </li>
  <li>
    Support external semantic infrastructures which may be based on representational approaches that differ from those being adopted by the Semantic Infrastructure 2.0
  </li>
</ul>

  Relationship of the Semantic Infrastructure 2.0 to caGrid 2.0
</h3>
The project to define the Roadmap for version 2 of the caBIG® semantic infrastructure, that is, the &#34;next generation&#34; of the current caDSR and EVS semantic infrastructure is being conducted in parallel with and is fundamentally coordinated with the caGrid 2.0 Roadmap project. The ultimate goal of the two efforts is to produce two complementary but integrated Roadmaps that will enable caGrid 2.0 to provide expanded semantic processing capabilities (when required) including but not limited to run-time service discovery and resolution of semantic queries. Details of both the Semantic Infrastructure 2.0 Roadmap and the caGrid 2.0 Roadmap, will be publicly available and open for community input.
