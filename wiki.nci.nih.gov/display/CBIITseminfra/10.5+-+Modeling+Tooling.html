Current Working Draft


Modeling Tools refer to the various modeling capabilities that will support the central Semantic Infrastructure services. Some of these capabilities might be implemented as services that may be used by the Knowledge Management Service. The exact approach will be determined at a later date based on architectural constraints.

Capabilities include:
<ul>
  <li>
    Plug-ins for existing tools like Enterprise Architect and Magic Draw that allow publication of models and Enterprise Conformance and Compliance Framework specifications from Enterprise Architect to the Knowledge Management Service, with support for topic maps and the Darwin Information Typing Architecture (DITA).
  </li>
  <li>
    Tooling to develop constrained models from existing Domain Analysis Models (DAMs) like LS-DAM and BRIDG, with support for wizards. The tool would enforce the constraints, allowing the user to carry the semantics into the implementation model.
  </li>
  <li>
    Ability to take an existing model and automatically bind with datatypes, concepts and value sets. The tool would support auto-discovery and make user recommendations
  </li>
  <li>
    Ability to specify custom datatypes and value sets and publish to the Knowledge Management Service. These datatypes can then be retrieved from the modeling tool to annotate the models
  </li>
  <li>
    Ability to export the models in variety of formats including Model Interchange Format (MIF).
  </li>
</ul>
