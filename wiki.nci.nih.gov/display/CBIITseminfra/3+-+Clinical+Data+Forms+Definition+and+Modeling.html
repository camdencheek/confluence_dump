Clinical Data Forms are the primary channel for capturing information in the healthcare and clinical domain. Forms also play a key role in information exchange and are critical to supporting interoperability in healthcare.

A form differs from a document in that the structure of the form is designed to incorporate skip patterns, validation rules, and other aspects required to capture the clinical data while the form takes that data and structures it in a meaningful way that reflects the clinical activity and the associated syntactical representation necessary to maintain the flow that clinical activity.

The key forms capabilities include:
