      <td>
        Box name:Metadata Management
      </td>
      <td>
        Provides for the expression, capture, storage, and retrieval of metadata, including models, datatype usage, terminology requirements and contextual aspects of model components (Note: The Metadata and Model Repositories logically reside in this area. This varies from but is in line with the solicitation as all repositories will be developed.)

        Box name:Metadata Stores
      </td>
      <td>
        Is concerned with providing context and meaning to data and will include data elements, terminology references, and informational knowledge.

    <tr>
      <td>
        Box name:Model Management
      </td>
      <td>
        Models constitute the expression of metadata elements for a particular domain or problem set. Model Management allows elements to be collected and related to provide for useful solutions. Models are described using OMGs XMI language, providing for the foundations of common tooling and expression. As important as XMI, are the human-readable models expressed in familiar UML. These models contain essential elements for solutions to function.

      <td>
        Box name: HL7 v3 RIM meta Infomation
      </td>
      <td>
        The precision afforded by HL7 V3 is afforded by models that are used to characterize data as well as metadata for a model&#39;s elements. Managing these models as Metadata allows use and reuse in the day-to-day operations of NCI, allowing precision and accuracy in exchanging data within the BIG Health scope

      <td>
        Box name: Knowledge Management Service Bus
      </td>
      <td>
        The Service Bus allows for a versatile, flexible approach to providing additional functionality that leverages the existing components of the semantic infrastructure. It is intended to leverage and extend other service bus solutions in service at NCI and to allow the integration of federated artifacts into NCI administered semantic infrastructure space. The Knowledge Management Service Bus exposes direct artifact retrieval as well as discovery services to identify knowledge components that may be of interest to applications. (Note: The Knowledge Service, Metadata Repository(MDR), and other services reside here and we consider the Model Service logically part of the MDR Service.)

        Box name:Knowledge Management
      </td>
