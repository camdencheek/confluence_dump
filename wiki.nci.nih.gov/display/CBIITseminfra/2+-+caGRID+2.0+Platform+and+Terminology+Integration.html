The Semantic Infrastructure supports seamless integration with the caGRID 2.0 platform.

The following are some high-level platform and terminology requirements that are either supported or addressed by the Semantic Infrastructure.

      2.1 - Export
    </a>
    Event Processing and Notifications enables monitoring of services in the ecosystem and provides for asynchronous updates by services, effectively allowing a loose coordination of services that both provide and respond to conditions (possibly defined in business rules).

      2.2 - Search and Access
    </a>
    This group of capabilities focuses on enabling developers of composite services and applications to discover, compose, and invoke services. This includes the discovery of published services based on service metadata and the generation of client APIs in multiple languages to provide cross-platform access to existing services.

          2.2.1 - Business Processing Policies and Related Rules
        </a>
        Policy and Rules Management allow non-developer secondary users to create policies and rules and apply them to services. The scope of policies includes, but is not limited to, definition and configuration of business processing policy and related rule. Some key functional requirements for managing policies include capabilities to author policies and store policies, and to approve and validate policies and execute policies at runtime.

          2.2.7 - Federated Metadata Discovery and Analysis
        </a>
        There are numerous data repositories on the web today. These data repositories contain essential information that must be accessible to services in the ecosystem. As a result, caGrid 2.0 must provide capabilities to integrate these external repositories into the grid with the assumption that the remote service cannot be changed.

          2.2.8 - Federated Repositories
        </a>
        The KR has to support Federated Repositories. The structure of each repository and the information models each contains may be different. At the M2 layer a range of meta-models have to be supported. For example, BRIDG models will be based on a HL7 meta-model, caDSR is currently using a ISO 11179 meta-model, CDISC is using the XML schema information model. Requirements include; 1. Federate the metadata infrastructure such that different organizations, departments, labs, software applications, etc. can maintain their own metadata while standards flow both top-down and bottom-up. The current semantic infrastructure at NCI is not amenable to this type of federated model. 2. Support querying across Grid 3. Support the ability to have data spread over the grid/internet, but know which data is the original, source of truth; concerns about data duplication and authorization - need to know where the authoritative data/information resides 4. Support federated sharing of data sources.

        </a>
        Service orchestration and choreography allows both application developers and non-developers to discover service &#34;building blocks&#34; that can be composed dynamically to provide business capabilities. Special cases include the orchestration of multiple services for a distributed query, or for a transactional workflow. Service orchestration and choreography will leverage static and behavioral semantics from the Semantic Infrastructure 2.0.
