The Semantic Infrastructure enables integrated access, search, and visualization of artifacts using a variety of search criteria, model serialization formats,  and user interaction empowerment tools.

The capabilities include:
<ul>
  <li>
    Semantic query enablement
  </li>
  <li>
    Model and form definitions download in multiple formats
  </li>
  <li>
    Search, using different criteria
  </li>
  <li>
    Seamless exploration across independent data sets from multiple sources
  </li>
  <li>
    Discovery of datasets
  </li>
  <li>
    Collaborative data sharing, model curation, and standards development
  </li>
  <li>
    Integrated set of friendly user interfaces for clinicians, researchers, scientists, and modelers
  </li>
  <li>
    Streamlined and simplified workflow, governance, and curation processes
  </li>
  <li>
    Unified access to all artifacts at all levels of granularity
  </li>
  <li>
    Browser-based navigation of model diagrams
  </li>
  <li>
    Tools to simplify and encourage reuse
  </li>
</ul>
The Search and Access profiles are derived from one or more of the following architecture implications:

Artifact Descriptions make use of defined semantics, where the semantics may be used for categorization or providing other property and value information for description classes. Architectural implications of semantics on the Semantic Infrastructure are reflected in the following capabilities:
<ul>
  <li>
    semantic models that provide normative descriptions of the utilized terms, where the models may range from a simple dictionary of terms to an ontology showing complex relationships and capable of supporting enhanced reasoning. This is a refinement of the Artifact metadata capability;
  </li>
  <li>
    mechanisms to support the storage, referencing, and access to these semantic models. This is a refinement of the Artifact store capability;
  </li>
  <li>
    configuration management mechanisms to capture the normative description of each semantic model and to apply a unique identifier in a manner consistent with an identified versioning scheme. This is a refinement of the Change configurationManagement capability;
  </li>
  <li>
    one or more mechanisms to support the storage, referencing, and access to conversion relationships between semantic models, and the mechanisms to carry out such conversions.
  </li>
</ul>
A well-defined service Behavior Model with the following capabilities:
<ul>
  <li>
    characterizes the knowledge of the actions invoked against the service and events that report real world effects as a result of those actions;
  </li>
  <li>
    characterizes the temporal relationships and temporal properties of actions and events associated in a service interaction;
  </li>
  <li>
    describes activities involved in a workflow activity that represents a unit of work;
  </li>
  <li>
    describes the role(s)that a role player performs in a service-oriented business process or service-oriented business collaboration;
  </li>
  <li>
    is both human readable and machine processable;
  </li>
  <li>
    is referenceable from the Service Description artifact.
  </li>
</ul>
A well-defined service Information Model with the following capabilities:
<ul>
  <li>
    describes the syntax and semantics of the messages used to denote actions and events;
  </li>
  <li>
    describes the syntax and semantics of the data payload(s) contained within messages;
  </li>
  <li>
    documents exception conditions in the event of faults due to conditions such as network outages and improper message and data formats;
  </li>
  <li>
    is both human readable and machine processable;
  </li>
  <li>
    is referenceable from the Service Description artifact.
  </li>
</ul>
A discovery mechanism which enables searching for artifacts that best meet the search criteria specified by the service participant and includes the following capabilities:
<ul>
  <li>
    Search for services, policies, and other artifact descriptions accessible via some repository mechanism;
  </li>
  <li>
    Search for operational characteristics of artifacts, which are metrics defined in artifact descriptions; the information is accessible via infrastructure monitoring capabilities or directly from services.
  </li>
  <li>
    Tracking and notification mechanisms related to artifact usage, service availability, operational conformance.
  </li>
</ul>
