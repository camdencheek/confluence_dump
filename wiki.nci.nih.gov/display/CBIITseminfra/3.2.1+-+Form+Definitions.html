        Artifact lifecycle management and metadata requirements include the ability to: * Manage lifecycle, governance and versioning of the models, content and forms * Establish relationships and dependencies between models, content and forms * Determine provenance, jurisdiction, authority and intellectual property * Create represention and views of the information, realized through the appropriate transforms * Provide access control and other security constraints * Create annotations for better discovery and searching of artifacts * Develop usage scenarios and context for the information * Provide terminology and value set binding The artifacts are bound to the services via the service metadata. The service metadata combined with the artifacts and supporting metadata provide a comprehensive service specification. The artifact management requirements listed above are derived from the following use cases: * caEHR: The caEHR project has adopted ECCF for specifications and CDA documents for interoperability. The caEHR project requirements include the need for an infrastructure for managing all the artifacts generated during specification process, including HL7 models and documents. The caEHR project also intends to publish these artifacts for the community and vendors. The infrastructure needs to support better discovery, making all the relevant information available in the right context. * ONC and other external EHR adopters: ONC has adopted CCD and CCR for meaningful use. All national EHR implementations are expected to support forms and the semantics of these forms play a critical role in interoperability. The semantic infrastructure must provide a mechanism to create, store and manage these forms. * Clinical Trials: Clinical trials use forms to capture clinical information, and the semantics captured by these forms are critical for interoperability and reporting. The semantic infrastructure must provide a mechanism to manage the lifecycle of these forms.

        The caDSR program is interested in building on its Forms tools to create standards-based data collection forms (e.g., Clinical Data Form).  The caDSR/Clinical Trial tools should be directly usable by the end user (e.g., cancer researcher) and not limited to metadata specialists.  Often, data collection will start in a few days or weeks and harmonized forms (i.e., map into caDSR data elements) are needed in a few days or weeks from when the localized data model is created. In the longer-term (3-to-5 years) CDISC is also interested in generating CDISC-standards based data collection forms (see CDISC-15). *Source:  * * Interview 5/24/2010, Dianne Reeves * CDISC SHARE Team 2 F2F - 06/09/2010, Dave Iberson-Hurst
