Structured terminologies provide a foundation for information interoperability by improving the effectiveness of information exchange. They provide a means for organizing information and serve to define the semantics of information using consistent and computable mechanisms.

Terminologies are constructed to meet scope specific domain requirements. The domain-specific nature of structured vocabularies often leads to variation in design patterns across the available terminology space. The ability to provide consistent representation and access to a broad set of terminologies enables multiple disparate terminology sources to be available to a community, and helps to ensure consistency across the domain space of that community.

Service interfaces to structured terminologies should be flexible enough to accurately represent a wide variety of vocabularies and other lexically-based resources.

At its most abstract level, the Common Terminology Services 2 (CTS2) specification is about a collection of resources--specifically code systems, value set definitions, concept domains, concept domain bindings, and value sets.

A resource can be a thing, abstraction, idea, process or nearly anything else that can be described. The resources themselves (for example, the class called &#34;tree&#34;, a process in medicine called &#34;surgical incision&#34;, the philosopher from Buffalo named &#34;Barry Smith&#34;) are outside of the scope of this specification.

A resource is designated by a proxy--a unique identifier that serves as substitute reference for the resource itself. The CTS2 specification depends heavily on the existence of unique identifiers.
