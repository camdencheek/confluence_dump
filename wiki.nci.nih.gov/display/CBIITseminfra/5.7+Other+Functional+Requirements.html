This section lists other functional requirements from the community that have not been directly traced up to a use case. Service capabilities have not been derived from these requirements at this time. These requirements are part of the Semantic Infrastructure 2.0 Roadmap and will be prioritized according to strategic objectives of CBIIT and resource availability. The following areas are included:
