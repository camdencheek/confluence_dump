  Introduction
</h4>
The Knowledge Management Service is the primary store for all Enterprise Conformance and Compliance Framework (ECCF) specifications, information models and service metadata in The Semantic Infrastructure 2.0. The Knowledge Management Service provides an overarching framework for better service discovery, and an easy mechanism to publish artifacts through multiple interfaces and tools.

Artifacts include different formats of models, both static and behavioral. The Knowledge Management Service will support artifact management, which includes the ability to manage both structured and unstructured content in specifications and forms, templates, and definitions. A service specification is made up of service metadata: artifacts and the metadata supporting these artifacts. Knowledge Management includes the ability to manage artifact lifecycle and authoring of artifact metadata.

The Knowledge Management Service will support a variety of different models and formats that address the needs of the broader community, from innovators to enterprise Service-Aware Interoperability Framework (SAIF) specifications. Formats include:
<ul>
  <li>
    Schemas: Extensible Markup Language (XML), Web Ontology Language (OWL), Resource Description Framework (RDF)
  </li>
  <li>
    Information Models: Unified Modeling Language (UML), Health Level 7 Model Interchange Format (HL7 MIF), ISO 11179-based
  </li>
  <li>
    Meta Models
    <ul>
      <li>
        HL7 Reference Information Model (RIM)
      </li>
      <li>
        Biomedical Research Integrated Domain Group (BRIDG)
      </li>
      <li>
        Life Sciences Domain Analysis Model (LS-DAM)
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    Transforms
    <ul>
      <li>
        Object Management Group (OMG) Ontology Definition Metamodel Tranforms
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    Model Constraints: Object Constraint Language (OCL), Schematron
  </li>
  <li>
    Data Types
    <ul>
      <li>
        ISO 21090/HL7 R2
      </li>
      <li>
        HL7 R1
      </li>
      <li>
        Primitives
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
The Knowledge Management Service provides capabilities to:
<ul>
  <li>
    Consolidate the ECCF specifications and supporting artifacts in one single repository.
  </li>
  <li>
    Provides an interface to specify and manage artifact metadata.
  </li>
  <li>
    Provide a mechanism to view information in multiple formats supported by transforms and the linking of business rules.
  </li>
  <li>
    Support contract management through interfaces for specifying service metadata.
  </li>
  <li>
    Provide a mechanism to validate artifact and ECCF conformance.
  </li>
</ul>

  Business Area
</h4>
This service supports the Semantic Infrastructure, and will be used by all NCI project teams and external adopters to publish ECCF specifications, service metadata and information models. The Knowledge Management Service will be the primary store for all metadata in the Semantic Infrastructure 2.0.
<h4 id="id-10.8KnowledgeManagementServiceScopeandDescription-ServiceDescription">
  Service Description
</h4>
The Knowledge Management Service will provide the following functionality:
<ul>
  <li>
    Manage lifecycle and versioning of the models, content and forms.
  </li>
  <li>
    Provide an automated mechanism to extract metadata from models, content and forms and populate the repository with information about the service or artifact.
  </li>
  <li>
    Provide a mechanism to store information in different back end stores and formats, such as RDF stores.
  </li>
  <li>
    Establish relationships and dependencies between models, content and forms.
  </li>
  <li>
    Determine and track provenance, jurisdiction, authority and intellectual property.
  </li>
  <li>
    Provide interfaces to publish ECCF specifications and artifacts from tools such as Enterprise Architect.
  </li>
  <li>
    Provide a mechanism to validate conformance of artifacts.
  </li>
  <li>
    Create multiple representation and views of the information, realized through the appropriate transforms, either user-defined or the existing transform provided by the Knowledge Management Service.
  </li>
  <li>
    Provide access control and other security constraints.
  </li>
  <li>
    Create annotations for better discovery and searching of artifacts.
  </li>
  <li>
    Specify usage scenarios and context for the information.
  </li>
  <li>
    Provide a mechanism for terminology and value set binding.
  </li>
  <li>
    Link and specify rules and algorithms to artifacts of a service.
  </li>
  <li>
    Import a new model for annotation, binding to terminology and value sets.
  </li>
  <li>
    Link the models to existing models, domains, or both and classify artifacts.
  </li>
  <li>
    Support collaborative development of metadata.
  </li>
  <li>
    Register a new artifact in the registry with its metadata including ECCF-specific information and its traceability to support provenance.
  </li>
  <li>
    Provide an interface for contract management.
  </li>
  <li>
    Provide interfaces for specifying service metadata, ECCF conformance statements and artifact metadata.
  </li>
</ul>
<h4 id="id-10.8KnowledgeManagementServiceScopeandDescription-ServiceScope">
  Service Scope
</h4>
The scope of the Knowledge Management Service is limited to providing interfaces to load and manage artifact metadata. In supporting these capabilities, the service will provide many interfaces to create, update, query and delete this information.
<h4 id="id-10.8KnowledgeManagementServiceScopeandDescription-ServiceInteractions">
  Service Interactions
</h4>
The Knowledge Management Service will interact with the following systems and services:
<ul>
  <li>
    Governance Service: The Governance Service uses the Knowledge Management Service to query for key metadata about the artifacts; this information is then used to define policies.
  </li>
  <li>
    Decision Support Service: The Decision Support Service provides a mechanism to construct semantic queries that can then be executed against the underlying artifacts; it also provides interfaces for functions such as generating reports. The Decision Support Service uses the Knowledge Management Service.
  </li>
