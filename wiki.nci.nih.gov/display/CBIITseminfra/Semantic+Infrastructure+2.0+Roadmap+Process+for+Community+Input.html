In order to capitalize on new informatics technologies and changing community needs, we are asking for your collaboration in the development of a roadmap for creating the Semantic Infrastructure 2.0, the next generation of caBIG® Semantic Infrastructure. As core stakeholders of caBIG® tools and technologies, your input is essential in guiding the development of expanded capabilities to support the rapidly evolving needs of the caBIG® community.

Building on a combination of current caBIG® semantic infrastructure technology, technology advances that have occurred over the past several years, and Lessons Learned from our collective experiences with the current Semantic Infrastructure including caDSR and EVS, the vision for Semantic Infrastructure 2.0 is to provide enhanced capabilities in the context of three overarching requirements:
<ul>
  <li>
    Lower barriers to entry for all stakeholders -- scientists, clinicians, technologists, and informaticists -- creating a working environment in which &#34;easy things are easy to do,&#34;
  </li>
  <li>
    Leverage the increasingly mature collection of publicly-available open source infrastructure and the expanding trends in user friendly platforms, and
  </li>
  <li>
    Continue to provide support and migration strategies for users of the legacy Semantic Infrastructure.
  </li>
</ul>
Please review this working draft and give us your input regarding the scope of the Semantic Infrastructure 2.0, specific capabilities that you see as essential for the success of the Semantic Infrastructure 2.0, or suggestions for improvement of the document. The Semantic Infrastructure 2.0 project team will review and post the disposition of all input received.

The Semantic Infrastructure 2.0 team will publish, at approximately every-two-weeks intervals, ongoing evolutions of the document to reflect substantive content changes as a result of both team input and community input. Each version will be publicly available for comment. The final version of the Semantic Infrastructure 2.0 Roadmap will be published by the end of September, 2010.

Thank you in advance for your contributions and ongoing engagement as we collaboratively develop the capabilities that will define the Semantic Infrastructure 2.0. This opportunity to collaborate and share your expertise will ensure that we can deliver the best possible product to the broad spectrum of users in the caBIG® community.
