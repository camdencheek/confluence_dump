  Description of the profile
</h6>
The Semantic Infrastructure provides the behavioral semantics required for dynamic composibility of services or generation of distributed queries. This includes runtime contract discovery.
An artifact is a managed resource within the Semantic Infrastructure.

An artifact is associated with the following capabilities:
<ul>
  <li>
    descriptions to enable the artifact to be visible, where the description includes a unique identifier for the artifact and a sufficient, and preferably a machine processible, representation of the meaning of terms used to describe the artifact, its functions, and its effects;
  </li>
  <li>
    one or more discovery mechanisms that enable searching for artifacts that best meet the search criteria specified by the service participant; where the discovery mechanism will have access to the individual artifact descriptions, possibly through some repository mechanism;
  </li>
  <li>
    accessible storage of artifacts and artifact descriptions, so service participants can access, examine, and use the artifacts as defined.
    Discovery is the set of capabilities which enable searching for artifacts that best meet the search criteria specified by the service participant.
  </li>
</ul>
Aspects of discovery include:
<ul>
  <li>
    Search for services, policies, and other artifact descriptions accessible via some repository mechanism
  </li>
  <li>
    Search for operational characteristics of artifacts, which are metrics defined in artifact descriptions.  The information is accessible via infrastructure monitoring capabilties or directly from services.
  </li>
  <li>
    Tracking and notification mechanisms related to artifact usage, service availability, operational conformance
  </li>
</ul>
Capabilities associated with discovery are delineated in the functional profiles inherited, and specialized, by the discovery profile, namely:
<ul>
  <li>
    Artifact
  </li>
  <li>
    Metrics
  </li>
  <li>
    Interoperability
    Descriptions provide up-to-date information on what a resource is, the conditions for interacting with the resource, and the results of such interactions. As such, the description is the source of vital information in establishing willingness to interact with a resource, reachability to make  interaction possible, and compliance with relevant conditions of use.
  </li>
</ul>
Architectural implications of  interoperability on the Semantic Infrastructure are reflected in the following capabilities:
<ul>
  <li>
    one or more discovery mechanisms that enable searching for described resources that best meet the criteria specified by a service participant, where the discovery mechanism will have access to individual descriptions, possibly through some repository mechanism;
  </li>
  <li>
    tools to appropriately track users of the descriptions and notify them when a new version of the description is available.
    Artifact Descriptions include references to metrics which describe the operational characteristics of the subjects being described
  </li>
</ul>
Architectural implications of metrics on the Semantic Infrastructure are reflected in the following capabilities:
<ul>
  <li>
    access to platform infrastructure monitoring and reporting capabilities
  </li>
  <li>
    access to metrics information generated or accessible by related services
  </li>
  <li>
    mechanisms to catalog and enable discovery of which metrics are available for a described artifact and information on how these metrics can be accessed;
  </li>
  <li>
    mechanisms to catalog and enable discovery of compliance records associated with policies, contracts, and constraints that are based on these metrics.
  </li>
</ul>

        Service orchestration and choreography allows both application developers and non-developers to discover service &#34;building blocks&#34; that can be composed dynamically to provide business capabilities. Special cases include the orchestration of multiple services for a distributed query, or for a transactional workflow. Service orchestration and choreography will leverage static and behavioral semantics from the Semantic Infrastructure 2.0.    The Semantic Infrastructure provides the behavioral semantics required for dynamic composibility of services or generation of distributed queries. This includes runtime contract discovery and negotiation to determine composibility of services based on service capabilities and constraints.    Another use case is dynamic retrieval and enforcement of the policies that are in effect for a service interaction in the areas of logging, validations, data transformation, or routing. This information can be used either during the design of the orchestration or during the execution of the defined flow.    Link to use case satisfied from caGRID 2.0 Roadmap: Federated query over the TCGA data and other data sets is performed using a service orchestration.

While the Resource identity provides the means to know which subject and subject description are  being considered, Provenance as related to the Description class provides information that reflects on the  quality or usability of the subject. Provenance specifically identifies the entity (human, defined role,  organization, ...) that assumes responsibility for the resource being described and tracks historic  information that establishes a context for understanding what the resource provides and how it has  changed over time. Responsibilities may be directly assumed by the Stakeholder who owns a Resource  or the Owner may designate Responsible Parties for the various aspects of maintaining the resource and  provisioning it for use by others. There may be more than one entity identified under Responsible Parties;  for example, one entity may be responsible for code maintenance while another is responsible for provisioning of the executable code. The historical aspects may also have  multiple entries, such as when  and how data was collected and when and how it was subsequently processed, and as with other  elements of description, may provide links to other assets maintained by the Resource owner.
