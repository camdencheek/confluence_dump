The BIG Health vision brings a lot more stakeholders into the KR. Each of these has their own governance processes in respect to metadata and terminology. At a minimum the KR has to be aware of these processes, and their outcomes, to be able to express the status of metadata definitions and terminology concepts it contains. Some stakeholders expressed the wish to manage their governance processes within the KR.

The Governance Processes Profile derives its capabilities from SOA Governance  and consequently specialize capabilities architecturally  implied by the concept of Governance.

Governance Processes specializes capabilities architecturally implied by its associated concepts of  Artifact , Governance , Management , Metrics .  The implied architectural capabilities are described in the following paragraphs.



Artifact An artifact is a managed resource within the Semantic Infrastructure.

An artifact is associated with the following capabilities:
<ul>
  <li>
    descriptions to enable the artifact to be visible, where the description includes a unique identifier for the artifact and a sufficient, and preferably a machine processible, representation of the meaning of terms used to describe the artifact, its functions, and its effects;
  </li>
  <li>
    one or more discovery mechanisms that enable searching for artifacts that best meet the search criteria specified by the service participant; where the discovery mechanism will have access to the individual artifact descriptions, possibly through some repository mechanism;
  </li>
  <li>
    accessible storage of artifacts and artifact descriptions, so service participants can access, examine, and use the artifacts as defined.
  </li>
</ul>
Governance Service Oriented Architecture is an architectural paradigm for organizing and utilizing distributed capabilities that may be under the control of different ownership domains. Consequently, it is important that organizations that plan to engage in service interactions adopt governance policies and procedures sufficient to ensure that there is standardization across both internal and external organizational boundaries to promote the effective creation and use of SOA-based services.

SOA governance requires numerous architectural capabilities on the Semantic Infrastructure:



Governance is expressed through policies and assumes multiple use of focused policy modules  that can be employed across many common circumstances This is elaborated in the inherited Policy profile.

Governance requires that the participants understand the intent of governance, the structures created to define and implement governance, and the processes to be followed to make governance operational.  This is provided by capabilities specialized from the inherited Management Profile.

Governance policies are made operational through rules and regulations. This is provided by the following capabilities, most of which are specializations of the inherited Artifact Profile:
<ul>
  <li>
    descriptions to enable the rules and regulations to be visible, where the description includes a unique identifier and a sufficient, and preferably a machine process-able, representation of the meaning of terms used to describe the rules and regulations;
  </li>
  <li>
    one or more discovery mechanisms that enable searching for rules and regulations that may apply to situations corresponding to the search criteria specified by the service participant; where the discovery mechanism will have access to the individual descriptions of rules and regulations, possibly through some repository mechanism;
  </li>
  <li>
    accessible storage of rules and regulations and their respective descriptions, so service participants can understand and prepare for compliance, as defined.
  </li>
  <li>
    SOA services to access automated implementations of the Governance Processes.
  </li>
</ul>
Governance implies management to define and enforce rules and regulations.. This is elaborated in the inherited Management profile.

Governance relies on metrics to define and measure compliance. This is elaborated in the inherited Metric profile.

Management Governance implies management to define and enforce rules and regulations.

Management is provided by the following capabilities:
<ul>
  <li>
    an information collection site, such as a Web page or portal, where management information is stored and from which the information is always available for access;
  </li>
  <li>
    a mechanism to inform participants of significant management events, such as changes in rules or regulations;
  </li>
  <li>
    accessible storage of the specifics of processes followed by management.
  </li>
</ul>
Metrics Artifact Descriptions include references to metrics which describe the operational characteristics of the subjects being described

Architectural implications of metrics on the Semantic Infrastructure are reflected in the following capabilities:
<ul>
  <li>
    access to platform infrastructure monitoring and reporting capabilities
  </li>
  <li>
    access to metrics information generated or accessible by related services
  </li>
  <li>
    mechanisms to catalog and enable discovery of which metrics are available for a described artifact and information on how these metrics can be accessed;
  </li>
  <li>
    mechanisms to catalog and enable discovery of compliance records associated with policies, contracts, and constraints that are based on these metrics.
  </li>
</ul>

        There are questions as to whether a local data element definition is the same or different from existing caDSR data element definitions.  The quality of definitions can vary and they are updated over time.  In addition, with caDSR the associated organizations each have a rich committee structure to review and curate data element definitions.  For example, CTEP (Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program) has a series of disease related committees that help submit, review, and approve clinical trial schema and has its own associated governance processes.   This means that community and common data elements should include associated subject matter expert or external standard provenance data as well as a defined governance process.  This should also includes who submitted the original community definitions, and who was involved in authoring the definitions at each of the normalization and harmonization workflow steps.  The workflows can vary based on the organizations involved.  Sources * Essentials of caBIG® Compatibility: From Theory to Practice – Metadata Reuse (2009 Presentation)   * Interview 5/24/2010 Dianne Reeves

        The CDISC SHARE (Shared Health and Research Electronic Library) Pilot report often found that the initial data element definitions were not of high quality and it was sometimes hard to find the original authors.  This means that community and common data elements should have associated subject matter expert or external standard provenance data.  This includes who submitted the original community definitions, and who was involved in authoring the definitions at each of the normalization and harmonization workflow steps, including their final release in a new or updated CDISC standard.  The current prototype workflow steps consist of:  (a) Contribute &amp; Link, (b) Merge (HL7 Normalization), (c) Harmonize (HL7 Normalization &amp; Harmonization) (d) New Definition (HL7 Normalization).   These workflow steps are outlined in the CDISC SHARE Pilot Report.   The KR should include a well-documented and automated (as much as possible) workflow mechanism to ensure that CDISC SHARE change/update and addition requests are handled efficiently and promptly.  As noted in CDISC-6, CDISC also wants the ability to construct and then re-define the harmonization workflow process.  CDISC states that governance in general and this kind of workflow control is central to the creation of successful CDISC standards.    *Source:  *   * Interview 5/20/2010 , David Iberson-Hurst &amp; Ronda Facile   * CDISC Share Pilot Report and CDISC Requirements Package 1 - NCI Semantic Infrastructure, 5/28/2010, Section 2.5

        Service Oriented Architecture is an architectural paradigm for organizing and utilizing distributed capabilities that may be under the control of different ownership domains. Consequently, it is important that organizations that plan to engage in service interactions adopt governance policies and procedures sufficient to ensure that there is standardization across both internal and external organizational boundaries to promote the effective creation and use of SOA-based services.     SOA governance requires numerous architectural capabilities on the Semantic Infrastructure: Governance is expressed through policies and assumes multiple use of focused policy modules  that can be employed across many common circumstances This is elaborated in the inherited Policy profile. Governance requires that the participants understand the intent of governance, the structures created to define and implement governance, and the processes to be followed to make governance operational.  This is provided by capabilities specialized from the inherited Management Profile. Governance policies are made operational through rules and regulations. This is provided by the following capabilities, most of which are specializations of the inherited Artifact Profile: * descriptions to enable the rules and regulations to be visible, where the description includes a unique identifier and a sufficient, and preferably a machine process-able, representation of the meaning of terms used to describe the rules and regulations;  * one or more discovery mechanisms that enable searching for rules and regulations that may apply to situations corresponding to the search criteria specified by the service participant; where the discovery mechanism will have access to the individual descriptions of rules and regulations, possibly through some repository mechanism;  * accessible storage of rules and regulations and their respective descriptions, so service participants can understand and prepare for compliance, as defined.  * SOA services to access automated implementations of the Governance Processes. Governance implies management to define and enforce rules and regulations.. This is elaborated in the inherited Management profile. Governance relies on metrics to define and measure compliance. This is elaborated in the inherited Metric profile.

        A service description is an artifact, usually document-based, that defines or references the information  needed to use, deploy, manage and otherwise control a service. This includes not only the information  and behavior models associated with a service to define the service interface but also includes  information needed to decide whether the service is appropriate for the current needs of the service consumer. Thus, the service description will also include information such as service reachability, service functionality, and the policies and contracts associated with a service.    A service description artifact may be a single document or it may be an interlinked set of documents.     Architectural implications of service description on the Semantic Infrastructure are reflected in the following functional decomposition:   * Description will change over time and its contents will reflect changing needs and context.  This is elaborated in the inherited Change profile.  * Description makes use of defined semantics, where the semantics may be used for  categorization or providing other property and value information for description classes. This is elaborated in the inherited Semantic Model profile.  * Descriptions include reference to policies defining conditions of use and optionally contracts  representing agreement on policies and other conditions.  This is elaborated in the inherited Policy profile.  * Descriptions include references to metrics which describe the operational characteristics of the  subjects being described.  This is elaborated in the inherited Metrics profile.  * Descriptions of the interactions are important for enabling auditability and repeatability, thereby  establishing a context for results and support for understanding observed change in performance  or results.  This is elaborated in the inherited Interaction profile.  * Descriptions may capture very focused information subsets or can be an aggregate of numerous  component descriptions. Service description is an example of a likely aggregate for which  manual maintenance of all aspects would not be feasible. This is elaborated in the inherited Composition profile.  * Descriptions provide up-to-date information on what a resource is, the conditions for interacting with the resource, and the results of such interactions. As such, the description is the source of vital information in establishing willingness to interact with a resource, reachability to make  interaction possible, and compliance with relevant conditions of use.  This is elaborated in the inherited Interoperability profile.      Policy capabilities are specialization of Artifact capabilities.

        One of the key requirements for participants interacting with each other in the context of a SOA is  achieving visibility: before services can interoperate, the participants have to be visible to each other  using whatever means are appropriate. The Reference Model analyzes visibility in terms of awareness,  willingness, and reachability.    Visibility in a SOA ecosystem has the following architectural implications on mechanisms providing  support for awareness, willingness, and reachability: Mechanisms providing support for awareness will likely have the following minimum capabilities: * creation of Description, preferably conforming to a standard Description format and structure;  * publishing of Description directly to a consumer or through a third party mediator;  * discovery of Description, preferably conforming to a standard for Description discovery;  * notification of Description updates or notification of the addition of new and relevant Descriptions;  * classification of Description elements according to standardized classification schemes. In a SOA ecosystem with complex social structures, awareness may be provided for specific communities of interest. The architectural mechanisms for providing awareness to communities of interest will require support for: * policies that allow dynamic formation of communities of interest;  * trust that awareness can be provided for and only for specific communities of interest, the bases of which is typically built on keying and encryption technology. The architectural mechanisms for determining willingness to interact will require support for: * verification of identity and credentials of the provider and/or consumer;  * access to and understanding of description;  * inspection of functionality and capabilities;  * inspection of policies and/or contracts. The architectural mechanisms for establishing reachability will require support for: * the location or address of an endpoint;  * verification and use of a service interface by means of a communication protocol;  * determination of presence with an endpoint which may only be determined at the point  interaction but may be further aided by the use of a presence protocol for which the endpoints  actively participate.

  Description
</h6>
While the Resource identity provides the means to know which subject and subject description are  being considered, Provenance as related to the Description class provides information that reflects on the  quality or usability of the subject. Provenance specifically identifies the entity (human, defined role,  organization, ...) that assumes responsibility for the resource being described and tracks historic  information that establishes a context for understanding what the resource provides and how it has  changed over time. Responsibilities may be directly assumed by the Stakeholder who owns a Resource  or the Owner may designate Responsible Parties for the various aspects of maintaining the resource and  provisioning it for use by others. There may be more than one entity identified under Responsible Parties;  for example, one entity may be responsible for code maintenance while another is responsible for provisioning of the executable code. The historical aspects may also have  multiple entries, such as when  and how data was collected and when and how it was subsequently processed, and as with other  elements of description, may provide links to other assets maintained by the Resource owner.
