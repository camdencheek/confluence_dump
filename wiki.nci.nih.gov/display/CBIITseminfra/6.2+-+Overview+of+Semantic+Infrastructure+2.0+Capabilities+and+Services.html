  </li>
</ul>
This document describes all the central Semantic Infrastructure 2.0 capabilities and services, organized by functional profiles that address the following requirements:
<ul>
  <li>
    Artifact Management
  </li>
  <li>
    Terminology and Platform Integration
  </li>
  <li>
    Forms Modeling
  </li>
  <li>
    Conformance Testing
  </li>
  <li>
    Service Discovery and Governance
  </li>
  <li>
    Reasoning and Inference
  </li>
</ul>
The functional decomposition of Semantic Infrastructure 2.0 reflects the structure of the requirements. Each functional profile is a grouping of capabilities corresponding to identified Semantic Infrastructure requirements. In addition all requirements identified during Gap Analysis (which immediately preceded roadmap development) have been merged into relevant functional profiles as capabilities with appropriate traceability to the Gap Analysis requirements.

The Semantic Infrastructure is a Semantic Service Oriented Architecture that conforms with the principles and guidelines specified by the corresponding OASIS Reference Models, Ontologies, and Architectures. Within this document, these standards are represented as Semantic Profiles. Conformance with these standards has architectural implications for the business-oriented functional profiles. These architectural implications are reflected as extended capabilities of each functional profile, with traceability to the appropriate Semantic Profile conceptual model for Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA). This traceability, and the associated contextual description, help provide a bridge between the domain-specific terminology used to express requirements and the terminology used to describe the Semantic Infrastructure architecture.


The functional profiles are organized by the Semantic Infrastructure Requirements as follows:

      4 - Conformance Testing
    </a>
    Services specifications developed by NCI and the community have to be testable to ensure that the implementation conforms to the specification.

      <li>
        <a href="https://wiki.nci.nih.gov/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=32769316" rel="nofollow">

          4.2 - Search and Access Conformance Statements
        </a>
        Conformance testing leverages the artifact and service metadata to validate that an implementation adequately addresses the requirements stated in the service specification. An example of service requirement is the ability to specify a response time in the specification (design time) and validate that this response time is valid for an implementation of the service. Additional test points include but are not limited to binding to specific terminologies and domain models.

          4.3 - Test for Conformance
        </a>
        Testing for SOA combines the typical challenges of software testing and certification with the additional needs of accommodating the distributed nature of the resources, the greater access of a more unbounded consumer population, and the desired flexibility to create new solutions from existing components over which the solution developer has little if any control. The purpose of testing is to demonstrate a required level of reliability, correctness, and effectiveness that enable prospective consumers to have adequate confidence in using a service.

The semantic infrastructure capabilities and services address requirements and use cases for each domain. In addition to the domain specific use-cases, the capabilities also address CBIIT internal development and architecture requirements. Specifically, CBIIT has standardized on Service-Oriented Architecture as the foundational principle for applications architecture and interoperability. CBIIT has also adopted a formal approach (Enterprise Conformance and Compliance Framework) for defining service specifications. The capabilities address both the requirements for supporting semantic interoperability, and the need to publish formal specifications that can be adopted by external organizations and vendors.

The search and access profiles for each requirement are different as they are customized to access specific information in a defined format. For example, platform tools like the orchestration engine will leverage specific metadata to determine compatibility between two services..
