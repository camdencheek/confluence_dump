caGrid 2.0 federated, semantically aware service-oriented architecture (sSOA) enables the development of a continuous and accelerated cycle of scientific discovery, diagnostics, pharmaceutical product development and improved clinical care. This supports diverse stakeholders – from patients to providers, researchers to regulators, administrators to advocates – and enables effective collaboration in ways never before possible.

Semantic Infrastructure 2.0 provides the underlying metadata and terminologies enabling interoperability on the sSOA. As such, semantic infrastructure must address the needs of the entire range of stakeholders that will be participating in development of sSOA.

The semantic infrastructure stakeholder list below defines the initial list of stakeholders critical to the success of Semantic Infrastructure 2.0. The stakeholders list is being enhanced during the community review of the Semantic Infrastructure 2.0 Roadmap, to ensure that the list includes the full range of the community that will be impacted by the Roadmap.

Table 2.1 Semantic Infrastructure Stakeholder List

The table above identifies stakeholder roles based on stakeholder category, groups within each category, and further sub groups based on distinct roles. Note that individual members of the community may fill multiple roles simultaneously.

An initial engagement plan is provided in the &#34;Planned/Targeted Engagement Option&#34; column for each stakeholder to ensure that stakeholder input is appropriately captured in the effort. Options are identified in the next column, &#34;Available Options.&#34;

Following are definitions of columns in the table:

Stakeholder Category: This defines the high level role of the stakeholder, which determines the type of engagement and interaction in the semantic infrastructure effort. The following stakeholder categories have been identified:
<ul>
  <li>
    Requester(s): This category consists of stakeholders that are primary decision makers in organizations, seeking to adopt semantic infrastructure in their organization.
  </li>
  <li>
    Payer(s) - System: This category consists of stakeholders that will be required to commit resources towards building semantic infrastructure
  </li>
  <li>
    Users (Direct Users) - This category consists of stakeholders that will be directly consuming the artifacts and solution developed by semantic infrastructure. Since the semantic infrastructure is the underlying IT platform, the primary users will be mainly technical users and will not be end users.
  </li>
  <li>
    Users (Secondary) - This category consists of stakeholders that will consume the artifacts produced by the direct users. These will be primarily end users, including but not limited to oncologists and bioinformaticians, who will interact indirectly with semantic infrastructure through the artifacts developed by technical users (direct users).
  </li>
  <li>
    Regulators: This category consists of stakeholders who create, implement, or both, policy guidelines that impact semantic infrastructure directly or indirectly.
  </li>
  <li>
    Collaborators: These are parties who are engaged in similar activity, where collaboration will help semantic infrastructure in reducing effort or provide an enhanced solution.
  </li>
  <li>
    Patients: This category consists of people who receive care and those who advocate on their behalf.
  </li>
  <li>
    Vendors: This category consists of health care IT vendors who will be consuming the open specifications developed by the semantic infrastructure team and provide their own interoperable implementations.
  </li>
</ul>
Groups: This defines different groups of stakeholders within a single stakeholder category, based on their role in the entire health care enterprise. (Refer to the table for the current list of groups.)

Sub Groups: Each group could be further subdivided into smaller sub groups, that would help determine an appropriate focused and targeted engagement plan, and ensure that the stakeholder requirements are considered at the tactical level. (Refer to the table for the current list of sub groups.)

Primary/Targeted Engagement Option: This column provides an initial engagement plan that would provide for getting stakeholder input to semantic infrastructure expeditiously . This will be enhanced in further drafts and based on guidance from community.

Available Options: These are ways available at the present time to provide for engagement.
