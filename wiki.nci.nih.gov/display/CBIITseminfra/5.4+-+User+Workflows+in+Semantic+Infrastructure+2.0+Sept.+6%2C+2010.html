This section describes user interactions with the Semantic Infrastructure tools and services. Specifically it addresses &#34;a day in the life&#34; of an developer, analyst, architect, clinician and bioinformatician as they use the tools. It provides an overview of the interactions, workflow and dependencies with external tools and platform. The following topics are included:

  Rule Authoring
</h4>
<ol>
  <li>
    A Clinical Decision Support (CDS) Rule Author receives notification of a new clinical decision support requirement.
  </li>
  <li>
    The Rule Author identifies the clinical logic required in order to implement the rule.
  </li>
  <li>
    The Rule Author identifies the required data elements from the metadata registry (ECCF). The data element identification is done at a level of abstraction consistent with the clinical logic contained in the rule, and is not dependent on the specific codings or formats contained in the actual patient data messages or document instances that are received and stored.
  </li>
  <li>
    The Rule Author codes the rule logic using Arden Syntax, and the data access expressions using GELLO, either through the use of an authoring tool or by hand.
  </li>
  <li>
    The newly created decision support rule is added to the rule base for subsequent evaluation (execution) by the rules engine when an associated rule trigger is activated.
  </li>
  <li>
    New or updated patient data is received which triggers the evaluation (execution) of the decision support rule. During the rule evaluation an attempt is made to retrieve all of the data that matches the data elements previously specified in the rule. The set of matching patient data instances for each specified rule data element is determined using the Semantic Infrastructure, based on the HL7 RIM objects and associated ontologies. This allows data that is encoded at lower levels of abstraction or more specific granularity to be linked and applied to the appropriate data elements specified in the rule, and for matching data instances to satisfy one or more of the rule criteria.
  </li>
</ol>
<h4 id="id-5.4UserWorkflowsinSemanticInfrastructure2.0Sept.6,2010-SearchandAccess">
  Search and Access
</h4>
If sufficient rule criteria are satisfied, then one or more specified clinical decision support actions are performed or scheduled. These actions may include, but are not limited to, sending an alert to a health care provider, creating a reminder for future action to be taken, adding an interpretation to the patient record, returning a result to a calling MLM, and evoking other MLMs.
