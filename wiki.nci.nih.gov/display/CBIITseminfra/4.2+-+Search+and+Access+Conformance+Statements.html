Conformance testing leverages the artifact and service metadata to validate that an implementation adequately addresses the requirements stated in the service specification. An example of service requirement is the ability to specify a response time in the specification (design time) and validate that this response time is valid for an implementation of the service. Additional test points include but are not limited to binding to specific terminologies and domain models.
