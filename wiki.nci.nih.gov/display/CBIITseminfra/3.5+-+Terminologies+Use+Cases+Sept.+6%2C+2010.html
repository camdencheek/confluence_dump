The National Cancer Institute has long been a leader in terminology related services and has provided the cancer community with structured terminology through the NCI Enterprise Vocabulary Services for several years. There are now a much wider range of terminology use cases for the needs from bedside to bench and back and Semantic Infrastructure 2.0 is being designed to address all of these use cases. The use cases require thinking beyond the capabilities of the existing metadata repository as demonstrated in caDSR and supporting semantic representations of concepts as they are used in clinical information exchange using the HL7 structured documents. Requirements are also recognized for binding concepts to information models in the abstract as domain values, for use in models such as the BRIDG domain analysis model or the life sciences DAM.

As NCI supports these new information models, a fundamental requirement is recognized to continue to support customers who have invested in the common data element capabilities of NCI over the last several years and to provide for customers to continue to use those elements while making the transition to Semantic Infrastructure 2.0. The result will be a more robust representation that captures semantics consistent with usage in clinical care and clinical research, The semantics will provide more nearly full coverage for the life sciences research community.

Below are several high-level use cases that highlight some of these demanding requirements.

  1 - Translate local codes to standard code systems
</h4>
A user has a local proprietary code system that the user would like translated to standard code systems adopted by the vocabulary and common data elements workspace. The user would like to be able to capture these local concepts in an Excel spreadsheet and submit them in a simple electronic way (such as an attachment to an email). The user would like to have the concepts returned with the original concepts, the new standard coded concepts with the quality of the mapping, and the definitions associated with the coded concepts. Furthermore the user would like the concepts returned as a CSV file.
<h4 id="id-3.5TerminologiesUseCasesSept.6,2010-2-Createnestedvaluesets">
  2 - Create nested value sets
</h4>
The user is building the specifications for a new application to manage follow-up of chemotherapy patients to track the signs and symptoms associated with a clinical trial of certain chemotherapy agents. The user has been given a set of CTCAE terms to capture the signs and symptoms but the set of symptoms listed is so large that it does not fit well into a single drop-down menu. The user would like to create subsets of these concepts according related organ systems affected. The user would like to have a unique identifier for each of these sets so they can be reused in future studies. The user has already investigated the available resources and did not find a collection of codes that met these requirements.
<h4 id="id-3.5TerminologiesUseCasesSept.6,2010-3-Retrievesemanticcodesystemcross-links">
  3 - Retrieve semantic code system cross-links
</h4>
A user is constructing a case report form and as part of the form, will have some data entry fields that correspond to laboratory tests that were ordered as part of the study. The user would like to constrain the inputs on the results of these tests to valid possibilities that can be provided via a menu selection. The user would like to submit a list of these laboratory tests to an application that can return an identified value set of possible ranges of answers and associated units of measure for each test. The user realizes that some of the tests will have results that are not available for some reason and would like the appropriate null representations returned as part of the value sets presented by the application.

  4 - Transform CTS 2 value set export to an HL7V3 coded data type
</h4>
A user is building a form that will correspond to a clinical document recording for a pathology report. The user would like the vocabulary drop-down lists to be derived from a CTS 2 value set but would like this value set to be delivered to the document in the syntactical structure required for validation against the CDA schema. In other words, the user would like to submit a list of concepts and have the concepts structured with metadata in a HL7V3 CD data type. The structure that the user anticipates would be delivered as an XML blob with the following structure:

&lt;code xsi:type=&#34;CD&#34; code=&#34;784.0&#34; codeSystem=&#34;2.16.840.1.113883.6.42&#34;&gt;

&lt;displayName value=&#34;Headache&#34; /&gt;

&lt;/code&gt;

  5 - Transform an ISO-11179 common data element to an HL7 V3 class object
</h4>
A user has a group of caDSR common data elements which have been used in form construction in the past. Now the user would like to move these forms to the HL7 CDA structure. The user finds it possible to represent a portion but not all of the contextual meaning of the data elements in 11179. The user would like to transform the CDEs to HL7 V3 class structures in order to get the full contextual meaning as used in the CDA document. The user would like to submit the list of CDEs to the ECCF registry transformer and have a set of V3 object classes returned.
