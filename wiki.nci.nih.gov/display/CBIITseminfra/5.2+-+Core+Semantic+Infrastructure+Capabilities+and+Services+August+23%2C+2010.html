This section describes all the core semantic infrastructure capabilities and services. The services are organized by functional profiles that aggregate the core services and capabilities. The profiles described in this section address the following requirements:
<ul>
  <li>
    Artifact Management
  </li>
  <li>
    Service Discovery and Governance
  </li>
  <li>
    Forms Modeling
  </li>
  <li>
    Conformance Testing
  </li>
  <li>
    Terminology and Platform Integration
  </li>
</ul>
The functional profiles organized by the requirements are as follows:Artifact Management

  </li>
</ul>
Service Discovery and Governance
<ul>
  <li>
    Analyze Services
  </li>
  <li>
    Administer Services
  </li>
  <li>
    Search and Access Services
  </li>
  <li>
