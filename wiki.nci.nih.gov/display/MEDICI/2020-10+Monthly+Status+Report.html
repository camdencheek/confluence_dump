            Integrated Azure&#39;s Kubernetes \ Storage \ Networks \ VM pools \ and Docker Registry pieces with CodaLab with the help from Patrick Flickinger. UPDATE: Ingress and cert-manager are working properly now. We are working to get the challenge upload process to work seamlessly. Seems CodaLab is prepending some links and routes with https instead of http and the normal workflow is interrupted. Patrick is working on a fix.

            We did indeed move to a GPU resource pool. I also increased our limits for VMs in East-US and East-US2 to make sure there is enough availability.
