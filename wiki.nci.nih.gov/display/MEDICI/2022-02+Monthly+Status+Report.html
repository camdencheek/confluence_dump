            MIDRC needs an annotation app as well as docker submissions for their project and while we are still waiting for resources for the challenge, we do have the annotation app up and running:

            . They have merged in code that was porting the proiect to python3 (previously I was doing this on my own). It still has some issues. Will keep monitoring it so we can get an updated codalab base for our projects.
            <ul>
              <li>
                UPDATE (1_07_2022): I emailed the codalab team asking for updates regarding the python3 port of the old codalab. I also asked about their future project codabench. They informed me that they are working on both but the python3 port for now (as they have a small team). They offered me a chance to join the meetings and perhaps help. I will join their Monday\Thursday calls to catch and see if and how I can help.

                UPDATE (1_31_2022): Need to work on github workflows in order to have my changes allowed into the codalab system.

                UPDATE (2_28_2022): I managed to get circleci (the current testing system) to work and even updated some of their code to update the way it is used. We will stick with this.
                <ul>

                    Also I tested the hello world competition on

                    and the first submission fails but the second works. They are aware but consider it a low priority issue.

                    On my local machine I deployed the updated CodaLab code and tried connecting to my own S3 bucket instance. I noticed that there is a javascript error making the request to the bucket. I need to setup up a similar but more simple setup to figure out how to upload data to s3 via javascript http requests so that I can trouble shoot the error on NCI&#39;s system and or mine. If we could use Azure, this might be resolved.
