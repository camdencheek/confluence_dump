                MIDRC - we are getting azure credits to deploy MedICI with docker submissions. Should be this month (November) - Still hasn&#39;t happened (12.9.2021)
              </li>
              <li>
                I&#39;ve been working to really make the image comparator code neat and organized. I want this project designed in a way that make additional features easy to add. I believe I&#39;ve achieved that
              </li>
              <li>
                The addition of a new app that allows a unique pairwise classification has been added to the app for the MIDRC project specifically. This feature allows two images to be displayed by patient and the goal is to use this to figure out which studies by patient have both a lateral and frontal chest xray. It&#39;s a test for Challenge 0 (practice docker submission challenge). So basically this app will allows us to find studies with both a good frontal and lateral xray so that we can create a ground truth to give to challenge participants for Challenge 0. The goal is to have participants create an AI algorithm that can correctly identify frontal and lateral chest xrays. If this challenge goes well then more complex questions will be raised and a challenge built around those questions will be formulated.

            - Dr. Mateusz Buda has reached out about a potential data problem for the test phase. I have send the code and data I used and we are working to make sure the challenge results from participants are accurate.Will be in touch with him over the next couple days to make sure everything is in order.

            . They have merged in code that was porting the proiect to python3 (previously I was doing this on my own). It still has some issues. Will keep monitoring it so we can get an updated codalab base for our projects.

            Jayashree has me collaborating with Steve Piper (sponsored collaborator) who has built a way to make OHIF (medical imaging viewer) talk to a database called couchdb. This is a nosql record style database that the app I&#39;m buillding for MIDRC is based on. The plan is to integrate OHIF into this app and be able to launch beside codalab and MedICI in general. This would allow ePAD and caMicroscope like functionality with more flexibility as well. Progress on this will come soon as I dive in.

                    On my local machine I deployed the updated CodaLab code and tried connecting to my own S3 bucket instance. I noticed that there is a javascript error making the request to the bucket. I need to setup up a similar but more simple setup to figure out how to upload data to s3 via javascript http requests so that I can trouble shoot the error on NCI&#39;s system and or mine. If we could use Azure, this might be resolved.

        Continuous development of CodaLab on NCI&#39;s network is exposing bugs in deployment and or CodaLab itself. This isn&#39;t an issue in theory, but I don&#39;t know how many issues I&#39;ll need to correct in order for the system to work. It is hard to estimate time to completion as a consequence.
