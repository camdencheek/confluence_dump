                We are using the forum to go back and forth as people test my tutorial (

                  https://github.com/QTIM-Lab/MedICI-Challenge-Bundles/tree/main/aks_MedNIST_bundle/README
                </a>
                ). There some interesting bugs that we are working out:
                <ol>
                  <li>
                    Windows uploaded zip files are not behaving the same as ubuntu or mac based ones.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    While not an issue on my system, some parts of the training algorithm require some adjustments and the organizers (MDRC folks) are requesting that I make code changes to the tutorial so that users don&#39;t have to figure that out. Sounds reasonable.

            With Carolyn&#39;s help the Kheops document has been revised to have a more fluid and professional language consistent with reports of this style. Jayashree has commented on the report and her comments are as follows:
            <ol>
              <li>
                what is the gap that you are trying to fill
              </li>
              <li>
                add 1/2 page about what medici is and why you are looking for something like kheops
              </li>
              <li>
                also the tone of the writing (especially closing thoughts) is pretty conversational - perhaps a more formal tone is preferred for  reports of this sort
              </li>
              <li>
                i would be careful about “Where we are with challenges, using KHEOPS solves no issue and provides a solution to a problem we don’t really have.”

                I&#39;ve been busy with MDRC project to fine tune the docker submission main platform and haven&#39;t had a chance to change code to add a phase. To elaborate, whatever code base I used for this codalab doesn&#39;t have an &#34;add phase&#34; button and so the only way to keep it open is to have the validation phase open indefinitely. This is related to 2 (a) (i ) from above under Completed This Month.

        Continued ascertaining the validity of v2 codalab (codabench). I honestly haven&#39;t had too much time because of the covid challenge platform. I did get it to launch but there are some issues. I plan to get it all ready and deployed with the MICCAI challenge from last year. Once I have that we can scan it on the NCI platform and run challenges there. Deploy &#34;develop&#34; branch of codabench code to see if it is farther along and more bug free.UPDATE: we will use old codalab ported to python3 with jQuery update.

This project is a collaboration with Microsoft that has been ongoing since July\August 2020. This should allow us to scale CodaLab up for more users to use and allow a robust docker submission platform.
