                    Total submissions in each phase by participant.

              <li>
                There were some late submissions that we wanted to make sure weren&#39;t too late to be allowed in the system.
              </li>
              <li>
                We also found a participant who never put their submission on the leaderboard but still wanted to participate so we had to manually add them.

                    This may take too long so while I will fill this out I need to maybe launch a version of this on Jayashree&#39;s Azure account to get this moving.

            . They have merged in code that was porting the proiect to python3 (previously I was doing this on my own). It still has some issues. Will keep monitoring it so we can get an updated codalab base for our projects.
            <ul>
              <li>
                UPDATE (1_07_2022): I emailed the codalab team asking for updates regarding the python3 port of the old codalab. I also asked about their future project codabench. They informed me that they are working on both but the python3 port for now (as they have a small team). They offered me a chance to join the meetings and perhaps help. I will join their Monday\Thursday calls to catch and see if and how I can help.

                UPDATE (1_31_2022): Need to work on github workflows in order to have my changes allowed into the codalab system.

                    On my local machine I deployed the updated CodaLab code and tried connecting to my own S3 bucket instance. I noticed that there is a javascript error making the request to the bucket. I need to setup up a similar but more simple setup to figure out how to upload data to s3 via javascript http requests so that I can trouble shoot the error on NCI&#39;s system and or mine. If we could use Azure, this might be resolved.
