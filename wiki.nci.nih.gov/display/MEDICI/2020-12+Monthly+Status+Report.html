            Kevin Olexa, from NCI is tried upgrading the JQuery of their deployment of the codalab MedICI instance over at NCI/NIH. It seems it will be a lot of work. The new plan is to have me try out the v2 codalab otherwise known as codabench (

            I have Patrick&#39;s code loaded and working almost in the cloud. While extremely close, the COVID challenge this was being built for will need to proceed with plan b. This is the standard docker submission we have talked about and will also have Okta integration and docker upload functionality.
          </li>
          <li>
            Scoring program integration for SPIE-AAPM was seamless. Mateusz Buda, a data scientist working on the Breast challenge, created an easy to use evaluation script that I could tie into codalab and is being used to score submissions.
          </li>
          <li>
            I have the start of the codabench deployed and it almost works. There is a problem with the static files not being able to be found so there is no style on the web app when browsed to.
