        Nodule mismatches from time 1 to time 2:-Hi, My colleague and I think we have spotted a possible error in the test data. While manually inspecting the nodules of interest in patients 2016, 2043, 2047, and 2061, we noticed the nodule at Time 2 appears to be in a very different location in the patient than in Time 1. We think the masks may be pointing to two different nodules. Although this could be our error, I thought I&#39;d point it out just in case. Thanks.

        CT scan cuts off unexpectedly:-Hi, I&#39;m not sure if this was intended, but I noticed the CT volume for patient 2016 (at Time 2) cuts off half-way through the patient. I think it may actually cut some of the nodule out of the scan too. Thanks.
