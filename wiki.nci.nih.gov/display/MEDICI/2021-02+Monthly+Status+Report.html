            Got a version of codabench to launch locally on my laptop. Codabench is the new and improved codalab. I still need to launch the miccai challenge on it to test it out.

            Finished creating the MedNIST sample challenge on COVID-Kubernetes deployment and addressed some bugs listed below:
            <ol>
              <li>
                FIXED: In results table the &#34;FILENAME&#34; is always &#34;trackingid&#34;, needs to be the image that was submitted.
                <img height="154" src="https://wiki.nci.nih.gov/download/attachments/embedded-page/MEDICI/2021-02%20Monthly%20Status%20Report/image2021-3-1_15-36-17.png?api=v2">
              </li>
              <li>
                FIXED: Image Uploads are slow and we need to address that. The solution we chose was to upload instructions for building an image and have it built on our server and then push it. Before we were sending 6+GB over HTTP. That was slow. Now we only send a couple MB and then we can build the image and send at much faster speeds.
                <img height="250" src="https://wiki.nci.nih.gov/download/attachments/embedded-page/MEDICI/2021-02%20Monthly%20Status%20Report/image2021-3-1_15-35-48.png?api=v2">
              </li>
              <li>
                NOT FIXED: Sometimes deleting an image from the repo changes the image upload html and I have to reset it. This shouldn&#39;t happen. This is quite elusive and I haven&#39;t spent a ton of time on it. It&#39;s really east to reset so it should never fully break the platform, but I do need to reset it every once in a while. I imagine this will become annoying over time and especially weekends.

            Continued ascertaining the validity of v2 codalab (codabench). I honestly haven&#39;t had too much time because of the covid challenge platform. I did get it to launch but there are some issues. I plan to get it all ready and deployed with the MICCAI challenge from last year. Once I have that we can scan it on the NCI platform and run challenges there. Deploy &#34;develop&#34; branch of codabench code to see if it is farther along and more bug free.
