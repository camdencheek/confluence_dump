            Didn&#39;t quite get around to fixing the codalab deployment on nci&#39;s network. A docker issue crept up again and I had to wait for Kevin Olexa to disable &#34;cylancecsv&#34;, some sort of anti-virus software.
            <ol>
              <li>
                UPDATE 1: We have fixed a server issue with Apache that wasn&#39;t allowing css and js files to be served to the front end.
              </li>
              <li>
                UPDATE 2: We have a new issue where specific AWS js files related to container storage are not being served and it&#39;s causing competition upload to stall and not complete as data cannot be communicated to AWS.

            We were able to see Kendall from ACR and deploy the DMIST data on 3 clients and 1 server. The basic setup works. I need to replicate this on azure credits we have that are being provisioned (We have them but are undergoing a security check before resources are provisioned). In the meantime there is a tutorial I need to do better understand the framework, but I have a good general flow for now.

            ONGOING - Continue the Federated Learning Document about integrating MedICI and Federated Challenges.
            <ol>
              <li>
                Document is pending some additional notes. We are currently working with ACR (American College of Radiology) to deploy some Federated Learning clients and servers and this will greatly help me understand the complexities involved with setting up Federated learning challenges. Next month hopefully I&#39;ll have a better idea of what goes into setting up a system like this.
