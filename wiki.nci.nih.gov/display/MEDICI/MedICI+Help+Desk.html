The imaging research community has executed a large number of challenges. Challenges are designed to validate and compare imaging analysis algorithms. The algorithms are applied to a dataset and the results of the validation are compared against the ground truth, which is a set of validation measures established by the challenges organizers.The MedICI Help Desk project supports the implementation of challenges using MedICI, which is a custom version of CodaLab Competitions, an open-source framework for running competitions that involve result or code submission. The challenges apply analysis algorithms to understand clinical phenotypes that are relevant to prognosis or treatment of cancer patients.
