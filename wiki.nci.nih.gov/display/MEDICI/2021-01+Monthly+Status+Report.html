                In results table the &#34;FILENAME&#34; is always &#34;trackingid&#34;, needs to be the image that was submitted.

                Sometimes deleting an image from the repo changes the image upload html and I have to reset it. This shouldn&#39;t happen.

            We won&#39;t need to go with plan-b anymore as it seems the kubernetes cluster deployment is working well.
          </li>
          <li>
            Scoring program integration for SPIE-AAPM was seamless. Mateusz Buda, a data scientist working on the Breast challenge, created an easy to use evaluation script that I could tie into codalab and is being used to score submissions.
          </li>
          <li>
            I have the start of the codabench deployed and it almost works. There is a problem with the static files not being able to be found so there is no style on the web app when browsed to.
          </li>
          <li>
            The forum and issue tracker were used in the SPIE-AAPM challenge
          </li>
        </ul>
        Things that could be improved:
        <ul>
          <li>
            SPIE challenge test phase leader board was showing multiple submissions by participants and should only show their best score. I can and did fix it manually but it&#39;s not ideal.
