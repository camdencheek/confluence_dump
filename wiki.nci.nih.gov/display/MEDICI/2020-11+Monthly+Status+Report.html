            I&#39;m currently working on a way to upload docker images via the Docker REST API. It&#39;s not going well. I have decided to switch to a different way using the regular docker push commands in bash.

            There is a risk that the kubernetes version, while close to finished, might be halted or put aside so that the COVID challenge can proceed. This wouldn&#39;t be so bad, but would mean I have to finish learning about the kubernetes version into 2021.

            Just making a mental note here that in the future we will need to upgrade CodaLab into it&#39;s newer version.

        Now that CodaLab has been deconstructed from its normal configuration (postgres as an azure service rather than container; codalab as a pod in kubernetes instead of container; codalab code in azure file shares rather than the host machine), getting all the pieces to talk to one another isn’t working seamlessly yet.
