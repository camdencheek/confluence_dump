        Questions about the data and submission :- Dear whom it may concern. I have some questions about the data in traing set 1. How you define the label A or O. Is it based on the gene marker like 1p19q and IDH mutation This question comes from the case 30 cbtctrain30 whole slide image which the right part of this slide is seems to be A rather than O. Addition this part of tissue seems to be grade IV not you state lower grade glioma tumor which usually to be grade II and III. 2. Is that mean we can use these two types of dataradiology and histology no matter how we process it to predict A and O This question comes from that you gave nothing about the ROI in these two type of data.
