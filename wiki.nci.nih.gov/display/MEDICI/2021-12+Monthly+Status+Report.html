            - Dr. Mateusz Buda has reached out about a potential data problem for the test phase. I have send the code and data I used and we are working to make sure the challenge results from participants are accurate.Will be in touch with him over the next couple days to make sure everything is in order.

            . They have merged in code that was porting the proiect to python3 (previously I was doing this on my own). It still has some issues. Will keep monitoring it so we can get an updated codalab base for our projects.

                UPDATE (1_07_2022): I emailed the codalab team asking for updates regarding the python3 port of the old codalab. I also asked about their future project codabench. They informed me that they are working on both but the python3 port for now (as they have a small team). They offered me a chance to join the meetings and perhaps help. I will join their Monday\Thursday calls to catch and see if and how I can hlep.

            Jayashree has me collaborating with Steve Piper (sponsored collaborator) who has built a way to make OHIF (medical imaging viewer) talk to a database called couchdb. This is a nosql record style database that the app I&#39;m buillding for MIDRC is based on. The plan is to integrate OHIF into this app and be able to launch beside codalab and MedICI in general. This would allow ePAD and caMicroscope like functionality with more flexibility as well. Progress on this will come soon as I dive in.

                    On my local machine I deployed the updated CodaLab code and tried connecting to my own S3 bucket instance. I noticed that there is a javascript error making the request to the bucket. I need to setup up a similar but more simple setup to figure out how to upload data to s3 via javascript http requests so that I can trouble shoot the error on NCI&#39;s system and or mine. If we could use Azure, this might be resolved.

                UPDATE (01_07_2022): Isabelle Guyon of chalearn.org has invited me to some zoom meetings with the maintainers of codalab. I will try to help bring codalab into the python3 future and help us to have a solid foundation for MedICI custom features as well as have code that might pass NCI inspection on the security side.
