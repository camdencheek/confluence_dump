            Participants start to use the new website. Most of them are able to upload docker image, and execute algorithms successfully. However, a few cases are failed because of unknown reasons. Ben believes that output path may be the reason. He can manually handle it but takes time.

            CodaBench is a new platform. It is risky to run new challenges. However, using CodaLab is quite difficult because of the old version of python. In future, TrueCT and MIDRC Challenge 1 are potential challenges.

We would also want to have a periodic, occasional test phase for people to get test results.BMMR2 - close on 21 Dec 2021 as previously planned. (David Newitt, Thu 10/28/2021 7:10 PM) - link to the challenge data will be de-activated on 12/1/2021. Update (01/20/2022): David Newitt retired.
