  Introduction to DataScope
</h2>
DataScope allows you to browse and integrate multiple data types and visualize massive amounts of data. Using interactive, linked filters and visualizations, you can narrow down the data you want to see and immediately see the results in bubble charts, data tables, image grids, and heatmaps.DataScope includes many filters for adjusting your view of the data. The filters that appear are those that an administrator has customized for your use with DataScope and are not necessarily represented in the screenshots in this guide. The filters represented in this guide are part of the DataScope demo, which includes data from a co-clinical study. This data includes clinical, radiology, and pathology data, and pathology images from University of California, Davis and the The Cancer Genome Atlas Breast Cancer (TCGA BRCA) study.Using the procedures explained in the
<a href="https://wiki.nci.nih.gov/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=323322540" rel="nofollow">
  DataScope Developer&#39;s Guide
</a>
, you can customize your data, available filters, and charts. This guide explains the way to manipulate the bubble charts, data tables, and image grids you use to visualize your data. This documentation does not yet include information about the heatmap visualization type.See DataScope in action in this

<h2 id="DataScopeUser&#39;sGuide-FilteringtheData">
  Filtering the Data
</h2>
DataScope includes many filters for adjusting your view of the data. Filters are cumulative, which means that you can apply multiple filters to help narrow down your results. The filters are also interactive, meaning that when you set one filter, you impact the rest. For example, selecting one age cohort may mean that data is not available for a certain ethnicity. For a more convenient view of the filtering options, click the arrow at the top of the Filtering Attributes panel. This expands the view of the filtering attributes so that they fill the screen.
<img alt="Arrow in the Filtering Attributes panel" width="325" src="https://wiki.nci.nih.gov/download/attachments/embedded-page/CTIIP/DataScope%20User&#39;s%20Guide/FilteringAttributesArrow.png?api=v2">
All of the filtering attributes appear, as well as a Download link, for downloading a spreadsheet of the data after you have (or have not) filtered it.
<img alt="Filtering Attributes of the Integrative Data Query Application" width="700" src="https://wiki.nci.nih.gov/download/attachments/embedded-page/CTIIP/DataScope%20User&#39;s%20Guide/FilteringAttributes.png?api=v2">
If you want to view the visualizations and filters at the same time, you can continue viewing the filtering attributes vertically. In this case, you may decide to hide some of the filtering attribute panels you do not want to use. Hide a panel by clicking the minus sign in the panel&#39;s upper left. Show it by clicking the plus sign in the panel&#39;s upper right.In the following example, the Group and Disease-Free Months panels are open.
<img alt="Filtering Attributes panels in the open position" width="400" src="https://wiki.nci.nih.gov/download/attachments/embedded-page/CTIIP/DataScope%20User&#39;s%20Guide/FiltersOpen.png?api=v2">
In the following example, all of the filtering attribute panels are hidden.
<img alt="Filtering Attributes, plus sign for filtering" width="350" src="https://wiki.nci.nih.gov/download/attachments/embedded-page/CTIIP/DataScope%20User&#39;s%20Guide/FiltersClosedAnnotated.png?api=v2">
<h3 id="DataScopeUser&#39;sGuide-ClearingFilters">
  Clearing Filters
</h3>
You must clear each filter individually by clicking
<img alt="Clear Filter button" src="https://wiki.nci.nih.gov/download/attachments/embedded-page/CTIIP/DataScope%20User&#39;s%20Guide/ClearFilter.png?api=v2">
in each panel. As you clear a filter, the number of records that meet your filtering criteria will likely increase. You may want to note a control value, such as the number of records in the group, to illustrate the change in selected records as you apply filters.
<h3 id="DataScopeUser&#39;sGuide-BarGraphs">
  Bar Graphs
</h3>
You apply filtering attributes differently depending on their graph type.  To filter attributes using a bar graph, click one or more bars. Due to the natural distribution of data, selecting a bar may influence the availability of other bars.In the following graph, none of the stages have been selected and each bar is represented by a different color.
<img alt="Neoplasm Disease Stages Bar Graph" width="320" src="https://wiki.nci.nih.gov/download/attachments/embedded-page/CTIIP/DataScope%20User&#39;s%20Guide/BarGraph.png?api=v2">
In the following graph, Stage IIA has been selected, making the other bars unavailable for selection.

<h3 id="DataScopeUser&#39;sGuide-Histograms">
  Histograms
</h3>
To filter attributes using a histogram, you have two options that accomplish the same thing:
<ul>
  <li>
    Click and drag the brackets to select a range. Click anywhere in the chart to show the brackets.or
  </li>
  <li>
    Enter the values of the range in the boxes below the chart.
  </li>
</ul>
In the following histogram, no values have been selected yet.
<img alt="Disease-Free Months" width="320" src="https://wiki.nci.nih.gov/download/attachments/embedded-page/CTIIP/DataScope%20User&#39;s%20Guide/Histogram.png?api=v2">
In the following histogram, a range has been selected, which exists between the brackets and appears in the range boxes below the chart. The values are entered automatically as you move the brackets.
<img alt="Disease-Free Months histogram, with the range of 21.7777 to 68.4444 selected" width="320" src="https://wiki.nci.nih.gov/download/attachments/embedded-page/CTIIP/DataScope%20User&#39;s%20Guide/HistogramSelected.png?api=v2">

  Understanding the Visualization Types
</h2>
DataScope is interactive and provides multiple options for visualizing a large database. These options include
<a href="https://wiki.nci.nih.gov/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=323323608" rel="nofollow">
  selecting filtering attributes
</a>
and viewing the data in a table, bubble chart (also called scatterplot or SPLOM), image grid, or heatmap.In the case of bubble charts, you can use these options in combination. For example, if you have already
<a href="https://wiki.nci.nih.gov/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=323323608" rel="nofollow">
  applied a filtering attribute
</a>
to show only one age group, you can further narrow down your selection by selecting a different category in the bubble chart.In the following example, a user has selected the filtering category of Asian and then further filtered the results to show those Asians between the ages of 30 and 40. Blue data points are selected, while grey are unavailable for selection.
<img alt="DataScope showing the selected Race-Category of Asian and the age range of 30-40" width="900" src="https://wiki.nci.nih.gov/download/attachments/embedded-page/CTIIP/DataScope%20User&#39;s%20Guide/FilterSelections-Annotated.png?api=v2">
<h3 id="DataScopeUser&#39;sGuide-UsingaDataTable">
  Using a Data Table
</h3>
A data table provides a tabular representation of the data. Data tables show 100 records at a time and you can page through them. The following is an example of a data table.
<img alt="Data Table with 100 entries" width="800" src="https://wiki.nci.nih.gov/download/attachments/embedded-page/CTIIP/DataScope%20User&#39;s%20Guide/DataTable.png?api=v2">
To select data in a data table, first click the DataTable tab, then click a row, which represents a patient. The patient is linked so that radiology data from The Cancer Image Archive (TCIA) can be retrieved in subsequent screens.A new browser window appears, showing patient information relevant to the radiology data.
<img alt="Row of data from the TCGA-BRCA collection" width="800" src="https://wiki.nci.nih.gov/download/attachments/embedded-page/CTIIP/DataScope%20User&#39;s%20Guide/DataRow.png?api=v2">
<h3 id="DataScopeUser&#39;sGuide-UsingtheSPLOMTab">
  Using the SPLOM Tab
</h3>
DataScope displays both various types of charts, including bubble charts and histograms, on the SPLOM (ScatterPLot Of Matrices) tab. Bubble charts are a type of scatterplot in which the data points are replaced with bubbles. An additional dimension of the data is represented in the size of the bubbles.
<img alt="SPLOM tab showing a set of bubble charts and bar graphs" width="800" src="https://wiki.nci.nih.gov/download/attachments/embedded-page/CTIIP/DataScope%20User&#39;s%20Guide/SPLOM.png?api=v2">
You can filter data on the SPLOM tab by adjusting the brackets in a histogram, as explained
<a href="https://wiki.nci.nih.gov/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=323323608" rel="nofollow">
  above
</a>
, or by defining a selection area in a bubble chart. Only blue bars or dots within the selection area are available for selection. The background of the area you have selected is shaded blue.

<h3 id="DataScopeUser&#39;sGuide-UsinganImageGrid">
  Using an Image Grid
</h3>
An Image Grid is a two-column list of images. When more screen real estate becomes available, the list of images expands to add more columns.
<img alt="Radiologic images on the ImageGrid tab" width="800" src="https://wiki.nci.nih.gov/download/attachments/embedded-page/CTIIP/DataScope%20User&#39;s%20Guide/ImageGrid.png?api=v2">
 To select an image grid, click the ImageGrid tab. All of the images matching the filters you selected appear. Click an image to open it in caMicroscope. Each time you click the image, it zooms in further. Learn more about using caMicroscope in the

  Heatmap
</h3>
A heatmap is a graphical representation of data in which the individual values contained in a matrix are represented by colors. The demo was not configured for this type of visualization, so this tab does not appear in the demo.
