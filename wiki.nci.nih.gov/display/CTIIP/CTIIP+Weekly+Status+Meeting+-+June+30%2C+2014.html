  Discussion Summary / Decisions
</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    Kick-off Meeting for DICOM contract scheduled for this Wednesday.
  </li>
  <li>
    Challenge RFP has been released.
  </li>
  <li>
    Need an update from John and Justin on MICCAI Challenge as it will work in conjunction with the CTIIP Challenge.  Will request that for next week.
  </li>
  <li>
    Cannot get a response from the various people we&#39;ve spoken with about collaborating on the co-clinical trial component of the project.  We may need to compete this portion of the project.
  </li>
  <li>
    Need to retire NCIA as it is the old version of NBIA and is no longer current / accurate.  We will revamp the page so that it has links to the up-to-date pages.  Ulli will talk with Clint when she returns from vacation to take care of it.  He will create a landing page NBIA, TCIA, NIAMS, wiki.
  </li>
</ul>
