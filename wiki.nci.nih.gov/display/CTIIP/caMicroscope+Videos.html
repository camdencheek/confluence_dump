caMicroscope supports the creation of human markups. Users can create freeform shapes, rectangles and drop pins on areas of interest. In addition to adding geometric shapes, users can also associate annotations to markups. These annotations are structured descriptions. The form that is used to capture this description (blue box that slides in on the left) is template-driven and can be customized. The annotations and markups are managed in a customized MongoDB environment and is accessible via an API.

Markup Services Video Description
This video has no sound. A description of the video follows.Using pre-defined annotation settings, user describes the annotation on a slide.User zooms in on an area of interest.User uses the drawing tool to mark up an area of interest.User views the slide and then submits the annotation.User shows that the annotation is stored in a JSON file.

caMicroscope can display machine generated annotations and markups. We provide tools and libraries that can process segmentation results and display these as overlays on the image. Results from multiple segmentation algorithms can be displayed.

Â Machine-Generated Annotations Video Description
This video has no sound. A description of the video follows.User clicks the magnifying glass tool to show the algorithms that have been executed on the slide.User demonstrates that markups display on the slide depending on the selected zoom level.As the user zooms and pans the image, the markups visible at that resolution in that area become visible.

A demo showing how caMicroscope can be integrated with containerized image segmentation algorithms. This allows one to draw a Region-Of-Interest (ROI) and run an algorithm on that region.

Dynamic Services Video Description
This video has no sound. A description of the video follows.User zooms to region of interest (ROI) and selects the ROI.User selects the gear icon.User makes a request to run an algorithm on this ROI.Work order shows the coordinates for the region of interest.User enters an ID for the test (Test1) and notes fields.User submits the work order.User shows the work order in the Kue job queue. This keeps track of the status of the work order. Only administrators can access this function.The highlighted section of the window shows how the data is being transferred from caMicroscope for execution.Green dots show the marked up features, which are the result of the algorithm that has been run on the ROI.
