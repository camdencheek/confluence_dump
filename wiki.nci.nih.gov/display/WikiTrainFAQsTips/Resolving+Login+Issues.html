    If you still can&#39;t log in, and you are sure you have an account, there may be a problem with your password.
    <ul>
      <li>
        Passwords expire periodically. NCI will send you an email reminder when you need to change your password.
      </li>
      <li>
        When you change your password, be sure to do it at
        <a href="https://iforgotmypassword.nih.gov/aims/ps/" rel="nofollow">
          I Forgot My Password
        </a>
        . This keeps your NCI and NIH passwords synchronized, so you can use the same password to log in on most sites.
      </li>
      <li>
        If you have trouble logging in, and you try repeatedly, your account will be locked and that will prevent you from logging in. You can unlock your account at
        <a href="https://iforgotmypassword.nih.gov/aims/ps/" rel="nofollow">
          I Forgot My Password
        </a>
        .
      </li>
      <li>
        If you have a password saved in an RSS reader or another web client, that can cause repeated failed login attempts and thus cause your account to be locked. Be sure to remove all such passwords from web clients.
