  Subscribe to updates by email
</h2>
You can subscribe to email notifications of changes on a page, changes in a whole wiki space, or changes in all wiki spaces you have permission to view. If you select Subscribe to daily updates, just after midnight the wiki sends by email a list of all the pages you have permission to view which have changed during the preceding 24 hours. For each page that has changed, the message indicates the most recent change on that page. To review that change, click the View Changes link. To review the other changes to any page, navigate to that page, click the Tools (...) icon, and select Page History.For details, refer to the following pages:

  View the changes on a page
</h2>
You can view the changes on a page, or compare any two versions of a page. Keep in mind the following points:
<ul>
  <li>
    After you create a page, Page History has your name under &#34;Changed By&#34; in the v.1 row.
  </li>
  <li>
    The comparison view is similar to the Microsoft Word comparison feature, rather than the Microsoft Word change tracking:
    <ul>
      <li>
        If you move C up between A and B, it might appear as if you had moved B down below C.
      </li>
      <li>
        If you change one small thing, Confluence might interpret it as a huge change.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    When there is a &#34;Migration of unmigrated content due to installation of a new plugin&#34; change, Confluence attributes that change to the last person who edited the page, even if that wiki user account is no longer valid.
  </li>
  <li>
    Sometimes, Confluence automatically does something to multi-excerpt include macros and table formatting. This automatic change appears in the comparison view along with your changes.
  </li>
</ul>
