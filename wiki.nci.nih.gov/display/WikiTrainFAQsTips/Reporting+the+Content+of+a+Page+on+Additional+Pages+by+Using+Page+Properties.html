The Page Properties and Page Properties Report macros provide the capability of showing information on different pages, each from a different point of view. As an example, an &#34;events&#34; report follows for multiple projects. The same report is shown in child pages, one for each project,
<a href="https://wiki.nci.nih.gov/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=249856535" rel="nofollow">
  Report of Project A Events
</a>
and
<a href="https://wiki.nci.nih.gov/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=249856541" rel="nofollow">
  Report of Project B Events
</a>
.To create a report like the &#34;events&#34; report that follows
<ul>
  <li>
    Set up the wiki page, with a heading for each project. This can be further refined, for example, with a page for each week and a heading for each project.
  </li>
  <li>
    Set up a Page Properties macro as the content of each section.
    <ul>
      <li>
        Type {page prop and when the macro browser opens, select the Page Properties macro.
      </li>
      <li>
        In the text box of the macro, enter a table with the report information. The information must be in a table.
      </li>
      <li>
        In the macro dialog box, enter a Page Properties ID. This is optional but needed for reporting when there is more than one Page Properties macro on a wiki page.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    Add a label to the page to signify the content. This is needed for reporting.
  </li>
</ul>
To create a page that reports the events for one project, like
<a href="https://wiki.nci.nih.gov/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=249856535" rel="nofollow">
  Report of Project A Events
</a>
and
<a href="https://wiki.nci.nih.gov/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=249856541" rel="nofollow">
  Report of Project B Events
</a>
<ul>
  <li>
    Create the wiki page for the project report.
  </li>
  <li>
    Enter a Page Properties Report macro on the page for each set of events you want to report for that project.
    <ul>
      <li>
        Type {page prop and when the macro browser opens select Page Properties Report.
      </li>
      <li>
        In the macro dialog box, enter the label of the page with the information to report; the Page Properties ID if there is more than one Page Properties macro; and other parameters as needed. In the examples, the &#34;Columns to show&#34; are specified in the order they should appear.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
