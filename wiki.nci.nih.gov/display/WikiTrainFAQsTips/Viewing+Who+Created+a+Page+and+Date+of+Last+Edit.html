When you open a page, look at the upper left part of the document window, just below the page title. The byline there includes the following information:
<ul>
  <li>
    The name (or username) of the user who created the page
  </li>
  <li>
    The name (or username) of the user who last edited the page (if not the same as the original author)
  </li>
  <li>
    The date on which editing last occurred (or the time, if it was a recent edit)
  </li>
</ul>
