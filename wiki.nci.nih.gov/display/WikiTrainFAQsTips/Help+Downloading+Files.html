.   Numerous PDF forms on this site are labeled as &#34;Fillable&#34;. Note that there are limitations on the functionality of these forms depending on the product you are using, as follows:
<ul>
  <li>
    If you have the free Adobe Acrobat Reader software you can fill the forms out and print them, you cannot save them. You must re-fill the PDF form every time you open it. The Adobe Acrobat Reader software functions this way by design, it is supposed to allow users to view PDF files, it is not designed to edit them.
  </li>
  <li>
    Software packages may be available that will allow you to complete, save and print the forms. However, it it essential that the type size and format specifications are met or the application will be returned without review.

  Saving Files Locally
</h2>
When you click a link to a file, your browser may open the document in the browser window, open the document in its native application automatically, or prompt you to save the file locally. The action the browser takes depends on your local browser/application configuration. You will need to have the appropriate application or file viewer (see free viewers above) to view these documents.
<ul>
  <li>
    If your browser automatically opens the document in it&#39;s native application or reader, you will have the option to do a File/Save to capture the document to your local computer.
  </li>
  <li>
    If your browser prompts you to download and save the file, choose an appropriate place on your local hard disk to store the file. You will want to carefully note the location you save to so that you will be able to find the file when the download is completed.
  </li>
</ul>
In addition, you can save a file by right-clicking the link, then saving it to a selected drive and folder.
<h2 id="HelpDownloadingFiles-UsingCompressedandArchivedFiles">
  Using Compressed and Archived Files
</h2>
In some cases, large individual documents or groups of files have been archived together and compressed into a single (smaller) file. File names of these archives end in &#34;EXE&#34; if you are a PC user or &#34;SIT&#34; for Mac users. Clicking on a link to an archived file file will result in that file being downloaded to your computer.Once downloaded, these compressed files can typically be uncompressed by simply double-clicking and choosing a destination folder to store them in.
