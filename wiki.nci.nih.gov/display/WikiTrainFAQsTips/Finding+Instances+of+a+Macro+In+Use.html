To find all content with a particular macro:
<ol>
  <li>
    Determine the macro name. You can do so by looking at a macro in Source Editor, or by looking it up in the available help for that macro. Here are some common examples:
    <ul>
      <li>
        htmlcomment
      </li>
      <li>
        multiexcerpt-include
      </li>
      <li>
        pagetree
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
