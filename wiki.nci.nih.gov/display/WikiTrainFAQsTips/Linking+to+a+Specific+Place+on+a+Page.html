A hierarchy of small wiki pages is easier to maintain than one large wiki page with sections. However, if you want to divide your content into sections within a single wiki page, you might need to create a link that points to a specific place on a page. To do so, you can link to an anchor (which is like a bookmark) or a heading. For instructions, refer to the following Atlassian help pages:

If someone moves an anchor or a heading from one page to another, Confluence does not update links pointing to that anchor or heading. Those links continue to point to the original page. If the anchor or heading no longer exists in that page, the link displays the top of that page.
