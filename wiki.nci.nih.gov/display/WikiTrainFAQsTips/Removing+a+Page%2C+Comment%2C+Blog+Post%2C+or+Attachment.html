.You can delete several pages together, if necessary. For example, consider the following procedure if you no longer need a set of draft pages for a software release. To check for potential broken links before deleting several pages:
<ol>
  <li>
    Move those pages into a separate page family. For example, you could create a &#34;Pages to Be Deleted&#34; page for this purpose.
  </li>
  <li>
    Request a deletion of the &#34;Pages to Be Deleted&#34; page, which would also delete all of the pages within that page family. Confluence notifies you of links that would break if you delete that page family.
  </li>
</ol>
Consider also checking whether the page is in use as an Include page somewhere. For instructions, refer to
