A hierarchy of small wiki pages is easier to maintain than one large wiki page with sections. However, if you want to divide your content into sections within a single wiki page, this page provides an example. This page has information about an important topic that is large, usually in scope and in amount of content. The information for this example fits on one page. Therefore subheadings rather than separate child pages are used and there is a table of contents. The Table of Contents macro for this page follows, with &#34;2&#34; as the minimum heading level to display.The following topics are included:
<ul>
  <li>
    <a href="#SecondLevelTopicExampleOne-Firstleveltwosubheading" rel="nofollow">
      First level two sub heading
    </a>
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="#SecondLevelTopicExampleOne-Secondleveltwosubheading" rel="nofollow">
      Second level two sub heading
    </a>
  </li>
</ul>
<h2 id="SecondLevelTopicExampleOne-Firstleveltwosubheading">
  First level two sub heading
</h2>
This is the first sub topic.
<h2 id="SecondLevelTopicExampleOne-Secondleveltwosubheading">
  Second level two sub heading
</h2>
This is the second sub topic. There may be many. Page length is up to you.
