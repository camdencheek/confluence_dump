To avoid creating lists of links that include pages users cannot view, rely on Confluence to generate the list of links.

  Most links generated by Confluence are visible only to users with permissions to view the pages

Use the Children Display macro or one of the Page Tree macros to list the child pages of any page. An example follows. This page family contains two example child pages.
<ul>
  <li>
    <a href="https://wiki.nci.nih.gov/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=20283881" rel="nofollow">
      A Child Page Everyone Can View
    </a>
  </li>
</ul>
When you are not logged in, the page displays one link in the list. When you are logged in, the page displays two links. Links in a list produced with the Children Display macro or one of the Page Tree macros are visible only to users with permission to view the pages.
<h2 id="ListingLinksSoOnlyUserswithPermissionCanViewThem-Linksenteredinthetextarevisibletoallusersbutdonotopenforuserswithoutpermissiontoviewthepage">
  Links entered in the text are visible to all users but do not open for users without permission to view the page
</h2>
Whether you are logged in or not, this link is available:
<a href="https://wiki.nci.nih.gov/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=20283872" rel="nofollow">
  A Page Restricted to One Group
</a>
. When you click the link, the response from the system depends on various factors:
<ul>
  <li>
    If you are not logged in, the login screen opens.
  </li>
  <li>
    If you are logged in and a member of the LDAP group, the page opens.
  </li>
  <li>
    If you are logged in but not a member of the group, a message appears indicating you do not have access to the page.
  </li>
</ul>
The same is true for links generated with the Page Index macro.
