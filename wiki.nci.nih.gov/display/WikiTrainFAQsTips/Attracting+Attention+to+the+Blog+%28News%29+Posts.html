This post shows how the excerpt function works in a list of blog posts created with the Blog Post macro. After 500 characters, the post appear to stop mid-sentence, and the reader can click the title to go to the original post and finish reading the entry. This function is useful when a title may not have enough information for the reader to decide whether it is valuable to read the entire post. The information shown in the list of blog posts is kept to a minimum.â€¦
