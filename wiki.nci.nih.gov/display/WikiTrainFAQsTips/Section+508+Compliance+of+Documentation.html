A few key actions can make content significantly more accessible.




Key Points

For accessibility:
<ul>
  <li>
    You must not merge cells in tables. Merged table cells are not Section 508-compliant.
  </li>
  <li>
    You must enter meaningful information in each table cell, as blank cells are not Section 508-compliant. Repeat data in each cell to which it applies. Indicate &#34;none&#34; or &#34;not applicable&#34; where appropriate.
  </li>
  <li>
    You must include alt text for every image posted on the wiki. In addition, describe the important aspects of the image in the text. Refer to
