      </li>
      <li>

        <a href="https://wiki.nci.nih.gov/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=140607985" rel="nofollow">
          Inserting Images or Tables in Numbered Lists

  </li>
  <li>
    Consider describing the change in a change comment for future reference:
    <ul>
      <li>
        The comparison view is not clear about image changes, such as when you add or edit alt-text, so consider mentioning that in a change comment.
      </li>
      <li>
        The comparison view is not clear about changes to the wiki page title, so consider mentioning that in a change comment.
      </li>
      <li>
        The comparison view is not clear about formatting changes, so consider describing the change in a change comment. For example, &#34;Applied bullet formatting.&#34;
      </li>
      <li>
        If you edit a page for a particular Jira ticket, consider mentioning that in a change comment.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    When you are done editing the page, click Save.
