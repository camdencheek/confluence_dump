Hey there! I'm Camden, one of the engineers working on Cody.

I heard we've had some requests to teach Cody about data sources
other than code. I was interested to see what we can do here,
so I hacked on this a bit today to test the waters and see how
far we can stretch Cody with other sources of information like
Confluence wikis.

We don't use Confluence internally, so I used the public wiki for
the NIH National Cancer Institute. I wrote a quick script to scrape
the wiki and dump a snapshot into a git repository. I fed that into
Sourcegraph, generated embeddings for it, and configured it as an
"always searched" information source, assuming that the info in an
org's wiki is always possibly relevant.

So, let's take a look at it in action

I don't know about you, but I can't always keep up with all the jargon being
thrown around. I frequently use our handbook to find definitions for acronyms.

So here's one I found when browsing the NIH wiki: NSAT

Normally, an AI wouldn't have enough organizational context to tell me
what this is, but if we give it access to confluence, it can use
the organization-specific definitions.

Another common problem of mine is figuring out who to ask.

Who should I consult about high-performance computing needs? (global)
Who is Eric Stahlberg?

What NIH projects use this repo? (repo-scoped)

What is a "concept" in an ontology?
Why is it useful to generate a transitive closure of a concept?
Write some java code that generates the transitive closure of the C23288 concept
